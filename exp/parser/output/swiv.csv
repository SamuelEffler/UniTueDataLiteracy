C3PO,There'll be no escape for the Princess this time,9

C3PO,Wait a minute where are you going,7
IMPERIAL OFFICER,The Death Star plans are not in the main computer,10
VADER,Where are those transmissions you intercepted,6
VADER,What have you done with those plans,7
REBEL OFFICER,We intercepted no transmissions Aaah This is a consular ship Were on a diplomatic mission,15
VADER,If this is a consular ship were is the Ambassador,10
VADER,Commander tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador I want her alive,19
TROOPER,There she is Set for stun,6
TROOPER,She'll be all right Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner,11
C3PO,Hey you're not permitted in there It's restricted You'll be deactivated for sure,13
C3PO,Don't call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease Now come out before somebody sees you,18
C3PO,Secret mission What plans What are you talking about I'm not getting in there,14
C3PO,I'm going to regret this,5
CHIEF PILOT,There goes another one,4

WOMAN,I've told you kids to slow down,7
FIXER,Did I hear a young noise blast through here,9
CAMIE,It was just wormie on another rampage,7
LUKE,Shape it up you guys Biggs,6
LUKE,I didn't know you were back When did you get in,11
BIGGS,Just now I wanted to surprise you hot shot I thought you'd be here certainly didn't expect you to be out working,22
LUKE,The Academy didn't change you muchbut you're back so soon Hey what happened didn't you get your commission,18
BIGGS,Of course I got it Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week First mate Biggs Darklighter at your serviceI just came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons,30
LUKE,I almost forgot There's a battle going on Right here in our system Come and look,16
DEAK,Not again Forget it,4
LUKE,There they are,3
BIGGS,That's no battle hot shot they're just sitting there Probably a freighter-tanker refueling,13
LUKE,But there was a lot of firing earlier,8
LUKE,Hey easy with those,4
CAMIE,Don't worry about it Wormie,5
FIXER,I keep telling you the Rebellion is a long way from here I doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system Believe me Luke this planet is a big hunk of nothing,35
LEIA,Lord Vader I should have known Only you could be so bold The Imperial Senate will not sit for this when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic,27
VADER,Don't play games with me Your Highness You weren't on any mercy mission this time You passed directly through a restricted system Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you,44
LEIA,I don't know what you're talking about I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan,20
VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor Take her away,13
COMMANDER,Holding her is dangerous If word of this gets out it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate,20
VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to her Now she is my only link to find their secret base,19
COMMANDER,She'll die before she tells you anything,7
VADER,Leave that to me Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed,18
SECOND OFFICER,Lord Vader the battle station plans are not aboard this ship And no transmissions were made An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting but no life forms were aboard,30
VADER,She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod Send a detachment down to retrieve them See to it personally Commander There'll be no one to stop us this time,31
COMMANDER,Yes sir,2
C3PO,How did I get into this mess I really don't know how We seem to be made to suffer It's our lot in life,24
C3PO,I've got to rest before I fall apart My joints are almost frozen,13
C3PO,What a desolate place this is,6
C3PO,Where are you going,4
C3PO,Well I'm not going that way It's much too rocky This way is much easier,15
C3PO,What makes you think there are settlements over there,9
C3PO,Don't get technical with me,5
C3PO,What mission What are you talking about I've had just about enough of you Go that way You'll be malfunctioning within a day you nearsighted scrap pile,27
C3PO,And don't let me catch you following me begging for help because you won't get it,16
C3PO,No more adventures I'm not going that way,8
C3PO,That malfunctioning little twerp This is all his fault He tricked me into going this way but he'll do no better,21
C3PO,Wait what's that A transport I'm saved,7
C3PO,Over here Help Please help,5
LUKE,so I cut off my power shut down the afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments As it was I busted up the Skyhopper pretty bad Uncle Owen was pretty upset He grounded me for the rest of the season You should have been there it was fantastic,62
BIGGS,You ought to take it easy Luke You may be the hottest bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous Keep it up and one day whammo you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall,49
LUKE,Look who's talking Now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle You've gotten soft in the city,24
BIGGS,I've missed you kid,4
LUKE,Well things haven't been the same since you left Biggs It's been so quiet,14
BIGGS,Luke I didn't come back just to say good-bye I shouldn't tell you this but you're the only one I can trust and if I don't come back I want somebody to know,33
LUKE,What are you talking about,5
BIGGS,I made some friends at the Academywhen our frigate goes to one of the central systems we're going to jump ship and join the Alliance,25
LUKE,Join the Rebellion Are you kidding How,7
BIGGS,Quiet down will ya You got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater,13
LUKE,I'm sorry I'm quietListen how quiet I am You can barely hear me,13
BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact,13
LUKE,You're crazy You could wander around forever trying to find them,11
BIGGS,I know it's a long shot but if I don't find them I'll do what I can on my own It's what we always talked about Luke I'm not going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side the side I believe in,58
LUKE,And I'm stuck here,4
BIGGS,I thought you were going to the Academy next term You'll get your chance to get off this rock,19
LUKE,Not likely I had to cancel my application There has been a lot of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead,28
BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one blaster,13
LUKE,I know but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off He needs me for just one more season I can't leave him now,27
BIGGS,I feel for you Luke you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important What good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire You know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant slaving for the greater glory of the Empire,65
LUKE,It couldn't happen here You said it yourself The Empire won't bother with this rock,15
BIGGS,Things always change,3
LUKE,I wish I was going Are you going to be around long,12
BIGGS,No I'm leaving in the morning,6
LUKE,Then I guess I won't see you,7
BIGGS,Maybe someday I'll keep a lookout,6
LUKE,Well I'll be at the Academy next season after that who knows I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure Take care of yourself you'll always be the best friend I've got,35
BIGGS,So long Luke,3
C3PO,R2D2 It's you It's you,5
FIRST TROOPER,Someone was in the pod The tracks go off in this direction,12
SECOND TROOPER,Look sir droids,3
C3PO,Wake up Wake up,4
C3PO,We're doomed,2
C3PO,Do you think they'll melt us down,7
C3PO,Don't shoot Don't shoot Will this never end,8
BERU,Luke tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce,15
LUKE,It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him,14
OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid,8
C3PO,Sir not in an environment such as this that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that,20
OWEN,What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators,15
C3PO,Vaporators Sir My first job was programming binary load lifter very similar to your vaporators You could say,18
OWEN,Do you speak Bocce,4
C3PO,Of course I can sir It's like a second language for me I'm as fluent in Bocce,17
OWEN,All right shut upI'll take this one,7
C3PO,Shutting up sir,3
OWEN,Luke take these two over to the garage will you I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner,22
LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters,13
OWEN,You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done Now come on get to it,18
LUKE,All right come on And the red one come on Well come on Red let's go,16
LUKE,Uncle Owen,2
OWEN,Yeah,1
LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator Look,8
OWEN,Hey what're you trying to push on us,8
C3PO,Excuse me sir but that R2 unit is in prime condition A real bargain,14
LUKE,Uncle Owen,2
OWEN,Yeah,1
LUKE,What about that one,4
OWEN,What about that blue one We'll take that one,9
LUKE,Yeah take it away,4
C3PO,Uh I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one sir He really is in first-class condition I've worked with him before Here he comes,26
LUKE,Okay let's go,3
C3PO,Now don't you forget this Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity,19
C3PO,Thank the maker This oil bath is going to feel so good I've got such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move,25
LUKE,It just isn't fair Oh Biggs is right I'm never gonna get out of here,15
C3PO,Is there anything I might do to help,8
LUKE,Well not unless you can alter time speed up the harvest or teleport me off this rock,17
C3PO,I don't think so sir I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things Not on this planet anyways As a matter of fact I'm not even sure which planet I'm on,34
LUKE,Well if there's a bright center to the universe you're on the planet that it's farthest from,17
C3PO,I see sir,3
LUKE,Uh you can call me Luke,6
C3PO,I see sir Luke,4
LUKE,Just Luke,2
C3PO,And I am See-C3PO human-cyborg relations and this is my counterpart R2D2,12
LUKE,Hello,1
LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action,19
C3PO,With all we've been through sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are what with the Rebellion and all,22
LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against the Empire,8
C3PO,That's how we came to be in your service if you take my meaning sir,15
LUKE,Have you been in many battles,6
C3PO,Several I think Actually there's not much to tell I'm not much more than an interpreter and not very good at telling stories Well not at making them interesting anyways,30
LUKE,Well my little friend you've got something jammed in here real good Were you on a cruiser or,18
LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi You're my only hope,8
LUKE,What's this,2
C3PO,What is what He asked you a questionWhat is that,10
LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi You're my only hope Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi You're my only hope,16
C3PO,Oh he says it's nothing sir Merely a malfunction Old data Pay it no mind,15
LUKE,Who is she She's beautiful,5
C3PO,I'm afraid I'm not quite sure sir,7
LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi,4
C3PO,I think she was a passenger on our last voyage A person of some importance sir I believe Our captain was attached to,23
LUKE,Is there more to this recording,6
C3PO,Behave yourself R2D2 You're going to get us in trouble It's all right you can trust him He's our new master,21
C3PO,He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi a resident of these parts And it's a private message for him Quite frankly sir I don't know what he's talking about Our last master was Captain Antilles but with what we've been through this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric,51
LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi,10
C3PO,I beg your pardon sir but do you know what he's talking about,13
LUKE,Well I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea He's kind of a strange old hermit,23
LUKE,I wonder who she is It sounds like she's in trouble I'd better play back the whole thing,18
C3PO,He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system He suggests that if you remove the bolt he might be able to play back the entire recording,29
LUKE,H'm Oh yeah well I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off Okay,20
LUKE,There you go,3
LUKE,Well wait a minute Where'd she go Bring her back Play back the entire message,15
C3PO,What message The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards,10
AUNT BERU,Luke Luke Come to dinner,5
LUKE,All right I'll be right there Aunt Beru,8
C3PO,I'm sorry sir but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter,13
LUKE,Well see what you can do with him I'll be right back,12
C3PO,Just you reconsider playing that message for him,8
C3PO,No I don't think he likes you at all,9
C3PO,No I don't like you either,6
LUKE,You know I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen,13
OWEN,What makes you think that,5
LUKE,Well I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi,20
LUKE,I thought he might have meant old Ben Do you know what he's talking about Well I wonder if he's related to Ben,23
OWEN,That old man's just a crazy old wizard Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed That'll be the end of it It belongs to us now,35
LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him,9
OWEN,He won't I don't think he exists any more He died about the same time as your father,18
LUKE,He knew my father,4
OWEN,I told you to forget it Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers,31
LUKE,Yes sir I think those new droids are going to work out fine In fact I uh was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season And if these new droids do work out I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year,48
OWEN,You mean the next semester before harvest,7
LUKE,Sure there're more than enough droids,6
OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most Only one more season This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands And then you can go to the Academy next year,39
OWEN,You must understand I need you here Luke,8
LUKE,But it's a whole 'nother year,6
OWEN,Look it's only one more season,6
LUKE,Yeah that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left,12
AUNT BERU,Where are you going,4
LUKE,It looks like I'm going nowhere I have to finish cleaning those droids,13
AUNT BERU,Owen he can't stay here forever Most of his friends have gone It means so much to him,18
OWEN,I'll make it up to him next year I promise,10
AUNT BERU,Luke's just not a farmer Owen He has too much of his father in him,15
OWEN,That's what I'm afraid of,5
LUKE,What are you doing hiding there,6
C3PO,It wasn't my fault sir Please don't deactivate me I told him not to go but he's faulty malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission,25
LUKE,Oh no,2
C3PO,That R2 unit has always been a problem These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand Even I can't understand their logic at times,24
LUKE,How could I be so stupid He's nowhere in sight Blast it,12
C3PO,Pardon me sir but couldn't we go after him,9
LUKE,It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around We'll have to wait until morning,14
OWEN,Luke I'm shutting the power down for the night,9
LUKE,All right I'll be there in a few minutes Boy am I gonna get it,15
LUKE,You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble,14
C3PO,Oh he excels at that sir,6
OWEN,Luke Luke Luke Where could he be loafing now,9
OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning,6
AUNT BERU,He said he had some things to do before he started today so he left early,16
OWEN,Uh Did he take those two new droids with him,10
AUNT BERU,I think so,3
OWEN,Well he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay,19
LUKE,How's that,2
LUKE,Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far We must have missed him Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well,36
C3PO,Sir would it help if you told him it was my fault,12
LUKE,Sure He needs you He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so,14
C3PO,Deactivate Well on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt,13
LUKE,Wait there's something dead ahead on the scanner It looks like our droid hit the accelerator,16
LUKE,Hey whoa just where do you think you're going,9
C3PO,Master Luke here is your rightful owner We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish and don't talk to me about your mission either You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here,37
LUKE,Well come on It's getting late I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up,19
C3PO,If you don't mind my saying so sir I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop,24
LUKE,No he's not going to try anything,7
LUKE,What's wrong with him now,5
C3PO,Oh my sir he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast,13
LUKE,Sandpeople Or worst Come on let's have a look Come on,11
LUKE,There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any wait a second they're Sandpeople all right I can see one of them now,25
BEN,Hello there Come here my little friend Don't be afraid,10
BEN,Don't worry he'll be all right,6
LUKE,What happened,2
BEN,Rest easy son you've had a busy day You're fortunate you're still in one piece,15
LUKE,Ben Ben Kenobi Boy am I glad to see you,10
BEN,The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly Tell me young Luke what brings you out this far,19
LUKE,Oh this little droid I think he's searching for his former master I've never seen such devotion in a droid before there seems to be no stopping him He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi Is he a relative of yours Do you know who he's talking about,51
BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi Obi-Wan Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time a long time,17
LUKE,I think my uncle knew him He said he was dead,11
BEN,Oh he's not dead not not yet,7
LUKE,You know him,3
BEN,Well of course of course I know him He's me I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh before you were born,23
LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you,7
BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid Very interesting,10
BEN,I think we better get indoors The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers,21
LUKE,C3PO,1
C3PO,Where am I I must have taken a bad step,10
LUKE,Can you stand We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return,14
C3PO,I don't think I can make it You go on Master Luke There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account I'm done for,25
LUKE,No you're not What kind of talk is that,9
BEN,Quickly son they're on the move,6
LUKE,No my father didn't fight in the wars He was a navigator on a spice freighter,16
BEN,That's what your uncle told you He didn't hold with your father's ideals Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved,23
LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars,6
BEN,Yes I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father,12
LUKE,I wish I'd known him,5
BEN,He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself And he was a good friend Which reminds me,30
BEN,I have something here for you Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow it He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did,40
C3PO,Sir if you'll not be needing me I'll close down for awhile,12
LUKE,Sure go ahead,3
LUKE,What is it,3
BEN,Your fathers lightsaber This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster,20
BEN,An elegant weapon for a more civilized time For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic Before the dark times before the Empire,34
LUKE,How did my father die,5
BEN,A young Jedi named Darth Vader who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights He betrayed and murdered your father Now the Jedi are all but extinct Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force,50
LUKE,The Force,2
BEN,Well the Force is what gives a Jedi his power It's an energy field created by all living things It surrounds us and penetrates us It binds the galaxy together,30
BEN,Now let's see if we can't figure out what you are my little friend And where you come from,19
LUKE,I saw part of the message he was,8
BEN,I seem to have found it,6
LEIA,General Kenobi years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit My father will know how to retrieve it You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan This is our most desperate hour Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi you're my only hope,111
BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan,16
LUKE,Alderaan I'm not going to Alderaan I've got to go home It's late I'm in for it as it is,20
BEN,I need your help Luke She needs your help I'm getting too old for this sort of thing,18
LUKE,I can't get involved I've got work to do It's not that I like the Empire I hate it But there's nothing I can do about it right now It's such a long way from here,36
BEN,That's your uncle talking,4
LUKE,Oh God my uncle How am I ever going to explain this,12
BEN,Learn about the Force Luke,5
LUKE,Look I can take you as far as Anchorhead You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going,22
BEN,You must do what you feel is right of course,10
TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped They're more dangerous than you realize,23
MOTTI,Dangerous to your starfleet Commander not to this battle station,10
TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as,15
TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away,35
TAGGE,That's impossible How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy,11
TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct control over territories Fear will keep the local systems in line Fear of this battle station,22
TAGGE,And what of the Rebellion If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station it is possible however unlikely that they might find a weakness and exploit it,31
VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands,12
MOTTI,Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture no matter what technical data they've obtained This station is now the ultimate power in the universe I suggest we use it,36
VADER,Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force,25
MOTTI,Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways Lord Vader Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort,39
VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing,7
TARKIN,Enough of this Vader release him,6
VADER,As you wish,3
TARKIN,This bickering is pointless Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke,33
LUKE,It looks like Sandpeople did this all right Look here are Gaffi sticks Bantha tracks It's just I never heard of them hitting anything this big before,27
BEN,They didn't But we are meant to think they did These tracks are side by side Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers,25
LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold us R2D2 and C3PO,11
BEN,And these blast points too accurate for Sandpeople Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise,14
LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas,8
LUKE,If they traced the robots here they may have learned who they sold them to And that would lead them home,21
BEN,Wait Luke It's too dangerous,5
LUKE,Uncle Owen Aunt Beru Uncle Owen,6
VADER,And now Your Highness we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base,14
BEN,There's nothing you could have done Luke had you been there You'd have been killed too and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire,27
LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan There's nothing here for me now I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father,30
BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy We must be cautious,19
TROOPER,How long have you had these droids,7
LUKE,About three or four seasons,5
BEN,They're for sale if you want them,7
TROOPER,Let me see your identification,5
BEN,You don't need to see his identification,7
TROOPER,We don't need to see his identification,7
BEN,These are not the droids your looking for,8
TROOPER,These are not the droids we're looking for,8
BEN,He can go about his business,6
TROOPER,You can go about your business,6
BEN,Move along,2
TROOPER,Move along Move along,4
C3PO,I can't abide these Jawas Disgusting creatures,7
LUKE,Go on go on I can't understand how we got by those troopers I thought we were dead,18
BEN,The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded You will find it a powerful ally,17
LUKE,Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan,16
BEN,Well most of the best freighter pilots can be found here Only watch your step This place can be a little rough,22
LUKE,I'm ready for anything,4
C3PO,Come along R2D2,3
BARTENDER,We don't serve their kind here,6
LUKE,What,1
BARTENDER,Your droids They'll have to wait outside We don't want them here,12
LUKE,Listen why don't you wait out by the speeder We don't want any trouble,14
C3PO,I heartily agree with you sir,6
CREATURE,Negola dewaghi wooldugger,3
HUMAN,He doesn't like you,4
LUKE,I'm sorry,2
HUMAN,I don't like you either,5
HUMAN,Don't insult us You just watch yourself We're wanted men I have the death sentence in twelve systems,18
LUKE,I'll be careful than,4
HUMAN,You'll be dead,3
BEN,This little one isn't worth the effort Come let me buy you something,13
BARTENDER,No blasters No blaster,4
BEN,This is Chewbacca He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our needs,13
C3PO,I don't like the look of this,7
HAN,Han Solo I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system,20
BEN,Yes indeed If it's a fast ship,7
HAN,Fast ship You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon,9
BEN,Should I have,3
HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs,13
HAN,I've outrun Imperial starships not the local bulk-cruisers mind you I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now She's fast enough for you old man What's the cargo,28
BEN,Only passengers Myself the boy two droids and no questions asked,11
HAN,What is it Some kind of local trouble,8
BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements,10
HAN,Well that's the trick isn't it And it's going to cost you something extra Ten thousand in advance,18
LUKE,Ten thousand We could almost buy our own ship for that,11
HAN,But who's going to fly it kid You,8
LUKE,You bet I could I'm not such a bad pilot myself We don't have to sit here and listen,19
BEN,We haven't that much with us But we could pay you two thousand now plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan,20
HAN,Seventeen huh,2
HAN,Okay You guys got yourself a ship We'll leave as soon as you're ready Docking bay Ninety-four,17
BEN,Ninety-four,1
HAN,Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your handiwork,11
TROOPER,All right we'll check it out,6
HAN,Seventeen thousand Those guys must really be desperate This could really save my neck Get back to the ship and get her ready,23
BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder,6
LUKE,That's okay I'm never coming back to this planet again,10
GREEDO,Going somewhere Solo,3
HAN,Yes Greedo As a matter of fact I was just going to see your boss Tell Jabba that I've got his money,22
GREEDO,It's too late You should have paid him when you had the chance Jabba's put a price on your head so large that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you I'm lucky I found you first,40
HAN,Yeah but this time I got the money,8
GREEDO,If you give it to me I might forget I found you,12
HAN,I don't have it with me Tell Jabba,8
GREEDO,Jabba's through with you He has no time for smugglers who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser,22
HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes Do you think I had a choice,12
GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba He may only take your ship,12
HAN,Over my dead body,4
GREEDO,That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time,14
HAN,Yes I'll bet you have,5
HAN,Sorry about the mess,4
VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable It will be some time before we can extract any information from her,21
IMPERIAL OFFICER,The final check-out is complete All systems are operational What course shall we set,14
TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion,10
VADER,What do you mean,4
TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this stationSet your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan,22
TROOPER,With pleasure,2
C3PO,Lock the door R2D2,4
TROOPER,All right check that side of the street It's secure Move on to the next door,16
C3PO,I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you I don't know what all the trouble is about but I'm sure it must be your fault,31
C3PO,You watch your language,4
LUKE,He says it's the best he can do Since the XP-38 came out they're just not in demand,18
BEN,It will be enough,4
BEN,If the ship's as fast as he's boasting we ought to do well,13
JABBA,Come on out Solo,4
HAN,I've been waiting for you Jabba,6
JABBA,I expected you would be,5
HAN,I'm not the type to run,6
JABBA,Han my boy there are times when you disappoint me why haven't you paid me And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that after all we've been through together,32
HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me,6
JABBA,Han why you're the best smuggler in the business You're too valuable to fry He was only relaying my concern at your delays He wasn't going to blast you,29
HAN,I think he thought he was Next time don't send one of those twerps If you've got something to say to me come see me yourself,26
JABBA,Han Han If only you hadn't had to dump that shipment of spice you understand I just can't make an exception Where would I be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped their shipment at the first sign of an Imperial starship It's not good business,47
HAN,You know even I get boarded sometimes Jabba I had no choice but I've got a charter now and I can pay you back plus a little extra I just need some more time,34
JABBA,Put your blasters away Han my boy I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you So for an extra say twenty percent I'll give you a little more time but this is it If you disappoint me again I'll put a price on your head so large you won't be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your short life,68
HAN,Jabba I'll pay you because it's my pleasure,8
LUKE,What a piece of junk,5
HAN,She'll make point five beyond the speed of light She may not look like much but she's got it where it counts kid I've added some special modifications myself,29
HAN,We're a little rushed so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of here,14
C3PO,Hello sir,2
TROOPER,Which way,2
TROOPER,All right men Load your weapons,6
TROOPER,Stop that ship,3
TROOPER,Blast 'em,2
HAN,Chewie get us out of here,6
C3PO,Oh my I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel,10
HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser Our passengers must be hotter than I thought Try and hold them off Angle the deflector shield while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed,34
HAN,Stay sharp There are two more coming in; they're going to try to cut us off,16
LUKE,Why don't you outrun them I thought you said this thing was fast,13
HAN,Watch your mouth kid or you're going to find yourself floating home We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace Besides I know a few maneuvers We'll lose them,32
HAN,Here's where the fun begins,5
BEN,How long before you can make the jump to light speed,11
HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navi-computer,12
LUKE,Are you kidding At the rate they're gaining,8
HAN,Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops boy Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick wouldn't it,34
LUKE,What's that flashing,3
HAN,We're losing our deflector shield Go strap yourself in I'm going to make the jump to light speed,18
MOTTI,We've entered the Alderaan system,5
LEIA,Governor Tarkin I should have expected to find you holding Vader's leash I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on board,23
TARKIN,Charming to the last You don't know how hard I found it signing the order to terminate your life,19
LEIA,I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself,11
TARKIN,Princess Leia before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now,32
LEIA,The more you tighten your grip Tarkin the more star systems will slip through your fingers,16
TARKIN,Not after we demonstrate the power of this station In a way you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed first Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan,53
LEIA,No Alderaan is peaceful We have no weapons You can't possibly,11
TARKIN,You would prefer another target A military target Then name the system,12
TARKIN,I grow tired of asking this So it'll be the last time Where is the Rebel base,17
LEIA,Dantooine,1
LEIA,They're on Dantooine,3
TARKIN,There You see Lord Vader she can be reasonableContinue with the operation You may fire when ready,17
LEIA,What,1
TARKIN,You're far too trusting Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration But don't worry We will deal with your Rebel friends soon enough,25
LEIA,No,1
VADER,Commence primary ignition,3
LUKE,Are you all right What's wrong,6
BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced I fear something terrible has happened,28
BEN,You'd better get on with your exercises,7
HAN,Well you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs I told you I'd outrun 'em,16
HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once,6
HAN,Anyway we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours,9
C3PO,Now be careful R2D2,4
C3PO,He made a fair move Screaming about it won't help you,11
HAN,Let him have it It's not wise to upset a Wookiee,11
C3PO,But sir nobody worries about upsetting a droid,8
HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose Wookiees are known to do that,20
C3PO,I see your point sir I suggest a new strategy R2D2 Let the Wookiee win,15
BEN,Remember a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him,10
LUKE,You mean it controls your actions,6
BEN,Partially But it also obeys your commands,7
HAN,Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid,16
LUKE,You don't believe in the Force do you,8
HAN,Kid I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other I've seen a lot of strange stuff but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny,43
HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense,9
BEN,I suggest you try it again Luke,7
BEN,This time let go your conscious self and act on instinct,11
LUKE,With the blast shield down I can't even see How am I supposed to fight,15
BEN,Your eyes can deceive you Don't trust them,8
BEN,Stretch out with your feelings,5
BEN,You see you can do it,6
HAN,I call it luck,4
BEN,In my experience there's no such thing as luck,9
HAN,Look going good against remotes is one thing Going good against the living That's something else,16
HAN,Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan,7
LUKE,You know I did feel something I could almost see the remote,12
BEN,That's good You have taken your first step into a larger world,12
TARKIN,Yes,1
OFFICER CASS,Our scout ships have reached Dantooine They found the remains of a Rebel base but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems,36
TARKIN,She lied She lied to us,6
VADER,I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion,10
TARKIN,Terminate her immediately,3
HAN,Stand by Chewie here we go Cut in the sublight engines,11
HAN,What the Aw we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower Some kind of asteroid collision It's not on any of the charts,24
LUKE,What's going on,3
HAN,Our position is correct except no Alderaan,7
LUKE,What do you mean Where is it,7
HAN,Thats what I'm trying to tell you kid It ain't there It's been totally blown away,16
LUKE,What How,2
BEN,Destroyed by the Empire,4
HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet It'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than I've,19
HAN,There's another ship coming in,5
LUKE,Maybe they know what happened,5
BEN,It's an Imperial fighter,4
LUKE,It followed us,3
BEN,No It's a short range fighter,6
HAN,There aren't any bases around here Where did it come from,11
LUKE,It sure is leaving in a big hurry If they identify us we're in big trouble,16
HAN,Not if I can help it Chewiejam it's transmissions,9
BEN,It'd be as well to let it go It's too far out of range,14
HAN,Not for long,3
BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own,13
LUKE,It must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something,12
HAN,Well he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone about us,14
LUKE,Look at him He's headed for that small moon,9
HAN,I think I can get him before he gets there he's almost in range,14
BEN,That's no moon It's a space station,7
HAN,It's too big to be a space station,8
LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this,8
HAN,Yeah I think your right Full reverse Chewie lock in the auxiliary power,13
LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it,7
HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam It's pulling us in,10
LUKE,But there's gotta be something you can do,8
HAN,There's nothin' I can do about it kid I'm in full power I'm going to have to shut down But they're not going to get me without a fight,29
BEN,You can't win But there are alternatives to fighting,9
OFFICER,To you stationsCome with me,5
OFFICER,Close all outboard shields Close all outboard shields,8
TARKIN,Yes,1
VOICE,We've captured a freighter entering the remains of the Alderaan system It's markings match those of a ship that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley,26
VADER,They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess She may yet be of some use to us,21
VOICE,Unlock one-five-seven and nine Release charges,6
OFFICER,There's no one on board sir According to the log the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff It must be a decoy sir Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned,31
VADER,Did you find any droids,5
OFFICER,No sir If there were any on board they must also have jettisoned,13
VADER,Send a scanning crew on board I want every part of this ship checked,14
OFFICER,Yes sir,2
VADER,I sense something a presence I haven't felt since,9
OFFICER,Get me a scanning crew in here on the double I want every part of this ship checked,18
LUKE,Boy it's lucky you had these compartments,7
HAN,I use them for smuggling I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them This is ridiculous Even if I could take off I'd never get past the tractor beam,30
BEN,Leave that to me,4
HAN,Damn fool I knew that you were going to say that,11
BEN,Who's the more foolish the fool or the fool who follows him,12
TROOPER,The ship's all yours If the scanners pick up anything report it immediately All right let's go,17
HAN'S VOICE,Hey down there could you give us a hand with this,11
GANTRY OFFICER,TX-four-one-two Why aren't you at your post TX-four-one-two do you copy,11
GANTRY OFFICER,Take over We've got a bad transmitter I'll see what I can do,13
LUKE,You know between his howling and your blasting everything in sight it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here,21
HAN,Bring them on I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around,13
C3PO,We found the computer outlet sir,6
BEN,Plug in He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network,13
C3PO,He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor,28
C3PO,The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave,26
BEN,I don't think you boys can help I must go alone,11
HAN,Whatever you say I've done more that I bargained for on this trip already,14
LUKE,I want to go with you,6
BEN,Be patient Luke Stay and watch over the droids,9
LUKE,But he can,3
BEN,They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan Your destiny lies along a different path than mine The Force will be with you always,32
HAN,Boy you said it Chewie,5
HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil,8
LUKE,Ben is a great man,5
HAN,Yeah great at getting us into trouble,7
LUKE,I didn't hear you give any ideas,7
HAN,Well anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up,16
LUKE,Who do you think,4
LUKE,What is it,3
C3PO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure sir He says ""I found her"" and keeps repeating ""She's here""",17
LUKE,Well who who has he found,6
C3PO,Princess Leia,2
LUKE,The princess She's here,4
HAN,Princess What's going on,4
C3PO,Level five Detention block A A-twenty-three I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated,13
LUKE,Oh no We've got to do something,7
HAN,What are you talking about,5
LUKE,The droid belongs to her She's the one in the message We've got to help her,16
HAN,Now look don't get any funny ideas The old man wants us to wait right here,16
LUKE,But he didn't know she was here Look will you just find a way back into the detention block,19
HAN,I'm not going anywhere,4
LUKE,They're going to execute her Look a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured Now all you want to do is stay,30
HAN,Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind,12
LUKE,But they're going to kill her,6
HAN,Better her than me,4
LUKE,She's rich,2
HAN,Rich,1
LUKE,Yes Rich powerful Listen if you were to rescue her the reward would be,14
HAN,What,1
LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine,7
HAN,I don't know I can imagine quite a bit,9
LUKE,You'll get it,3
HAN,I better,2
LUKE,You will,2
HAN,All right kid But you'd better be right about this,10
LUKE,All right,2
HAN,What's your plan,3
LUKE,Uh C3PO hand me those binders there will you,9
LUKE,Okay Now I'm going to put these on you,9
LUKE,Okay Han you put these on,6
HAN,Don't worry Chewie I think I know what he has in mind,12
C3PO,Master Luke sir Pardon me for asking but ah what should R2D2 and I do if we're discovered here,19
LUKE,Lock the door,3
HAN,And hope they don't have blasters,6
C3PO,That isn't very reassuring,4
LUKE,I can't see a thing in this helmet,8
HAN,This is not going to work,6
LUKE,Why didn't you say so before,6
HAN,I did say so before,5
OFFICER,Where are you taking this thing,6
LUKE,Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight,5
OFFICER,I wasn't notified I'll have to clear it,8
HAN,Look out He's loose,4
LUKE,He's going to pull us all apart,7
HAN,Go get him,3
HAN,We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in Here it is cell twenty-one-eight-seven You go get her I'll hold them here,26
HAN,Everything is under control Situation normal,6
INTERCOM VOICE,What happened,2
HAN,Uh had a slight weapons malfunction But uh everything's perfectly all right now We're fine We're all fine here now thank you How are you,25
INTERCOM VOICE,We're sending a squad up,5
HAN,Uh uh negative We had a reactor leak here now Give us a few minutes to lock it down Large leak very dangerous,23
INTERCOM VOICE,Who is this What's your operating number,7
HAN,Boring conversation anywayLuke We're going to have company,8
LEIA,Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper,9
LUKE,What Oh the uniform I'm Luke Skywalker I'm here to rescue you,12
LEIA,You're who,2
LUKE,I'm here to rescue you I've got your R2 unit I'm here with Ben Kenobi,15
LEIA,Ben Kenobi is here Where is he,7
LUKE,Come on,2
VADER,He is here,3
TARKIN,Obi-Wan Kenobi What makes you think so,7
VADER,A tremor in the Force The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master,19
TARKIN,Surely he must be dead by now,7
VADER,Don't underestimate the power of the Force,7
TARKIN,The Jedi are extinct their fire has gone out of the universe You my friend are all that's left of their religion,22
TARKIN,Yes,1
INTERCOM VOICE,Governor Tarkin we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three,12
TARKIN,The princess Put all sections on alert,7
VADER,Obi-Wan is here The Force is with him,8
TARKIN,If you're right he must not be allowed to escape,10
VADER,Escape is not his plan I must face him alone,10
HAN,Chewie,1
HAN,Get behind me Get behind me,6
HAN,Can't get out that way,5
LEIA,Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route,11
HAN,Maybe you'd like it back in your cell Your Highness,10
LUKE,See-C3PO See-C3PO,2
C3PO,Yes sir,2
LUKE,We've been cut off Are there any other ways out of the cell bay What was that I didn't copy,20
C3PO,I said all systems have been alerted to your presence sir The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted,31
TROOPER VOICE,Open up in there,4
C3PO,Oh no,2
LUKE,There isn't any other way out,6
HAN,I can't hold them off forever Now what,8
LEIA,This is some rescue When you came in here didn't you have a plan for getting out,17
HAN,He's the brains sweetheart,4
LUKE,Well I didn't,3
HAN,What the hell are you doing,6
LEIA,Somebody has to save our skins Into the garbage chute wise guy,12
HAN,Get in there you big furry oaf I don't care what you smell Get in there and don't worry about it,21
HAN,Wonderful girl Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to like her Get in there,17
HAN,Oh The garbage chute was a really wonderful idea What an incredible smell you've discovered Let's get out of here Get away from there,24
LUKE,No wait,2
LUKE,Will you forget it I already tried it It's magnetically sealed,11
LEIA,Put that thing away You're going to get us all killed,11
HAN,Absolutely Your Worship Look I had everything under control until you led us down here You know it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us,31
LEIA,It could be worse,4
HAN,It's worse,2
LUKE,There's something alive in here,5
HAN,That's your imagination,3
LUKE,Something just moves past my leg Look Did you see that,11

LUKE,The walls are moving,4
LEIA,Don't just stand there Try to brace it with something,10
LUKE,Wait a minute,3
LUKE,C3PO Come in C3PO C3PO Where could he be,9

FIRST OFFICER,Follow me You stand guard,5

LUKE,Hey hey open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number where are we,13

BEN,Only a master of evil Darth,6
VADER,Your powers are weak old man,6
BEN,You can't win Darth If you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,19
HAN,Didn't we just leave this party,6
HAN,What kept you,3
LEIA,We ran into some old friends,6
LUKE,Is the ship all right,5
HAN,Seems okay if we can get to it Just hope the old man got the tractor beam out of commission,20

BEN'S VOICE,Run Luke Run,3
HAN,I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission or this is going to be a real short trip Okay hit it,25
HAN,We're coming up on the sentry ships Hold 'em off Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns,21
LUKE,I can't believe he's gone,5
LEIA,There wasn't anything you could have done,7
HAN,Come on buddy we're not out of this yet,9
HAN,You in kid Okay stay sharp,6
LEIA,Here they come,3
LUKE,They're coming in too fast,5
C3PO,Oooh,1
LEIA,We've lost lateral controls,4
HAN,Don't worry she'll hold together,5
HAN,You hear me baby Hold together,6
LUKE,Got him I got him,5
HAN,Great kid Don't get cocky,5
LEIA,There are still two more of them out there,9
LUKE,That's it We did it,5
LEIA,We did it,3
C3PO,Help I think I'm meltingThis is all your fault,9
TARKIN,Are they away,3
VADER,They have just made the jump into hyperspace,8
TARKIN,You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship I'm taking an awful risk Vader This had better work,20
HAN,Not a bad bit of rescuing huh You know sometimes I even amaze myself,14
LEIA,That doesn't sound too hard Besides they let us go It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape,20
HAN,Easy you call that easy,5
LEIA,Their tracking us,3
HAN,Not this ship sister,4
LEIA,At least the information in R2D2 is still intact,9
HAN,What's so important What's he carrying,6
LEIA,The technical readouts of that battle station I only hope that when the data is analyzed a weakness can be found It's not over yet,25
HAN,It is for me sister Look I ain't in this for your revolution and I'm not in it for you Princess I expect to be well paid I'm in it for the money,33
LEIA,You needn't worry about your reward If money is all that you love then that's what you'll receive,18
LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary I wonder if he really cares about anything or anyone,16
LUKE,I care,2
LUKE,So what do you think of her Han,8
HAN,I'm trying not to kid,5
LUKE,Good,1
HAN,Still she's got a lot of spirit I don't know what do you think Do you think a princess and a guy like me,24
LUKE,No,1
WILLARD,You're safe We had feared the worst,7
WILLARD,When we heard about Alderaan we were afraid that you were lost along with your father,16
LEIA,We don't have time for our sorrows Commander The battle station has surely tracked us hereIt's the only explanation for the ease of our escape You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack It is our only hope,43
TARKIN,Yes,1
DODONNA,The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a firepower greater than half the star fleet It's defenses are designed around a direct large-scale assault A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense,37
GOLD LEADER,Pardon me for asking sir but what good are snub fighters going to be against that,16
DODONNA,Well the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be any threat or they'd have a tighter defense An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station,36
DODONNA,The approach will not be easy You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point The target area is only two meters wide It's a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port The shaft leads directly to the reactor system A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should destroy the station,62
DODONNA,Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction The shaft is ray-shielded so you'll have to use proton torpedoes,21
WEDGE,That's impossible even for a computer,6
LUKE,It's not impossible I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home They're not much bigger than two meters,21
DODONNA,Man your ships And may the Force be with you,10
VADER,This will be a day long remembered It has seen the end of Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion,24
MAN'S VOICE,All flight trooper man your stations All flight troops man your stations,12
LUKE,So you got your reward and you're just leaving then,10
HAN,That's right yeah I got some old debts I've got to pay off with this stuff Even if I didn't you don't think I'd be fool enough to stick around here do you Why don't you come with us You're pretty good in a fight I could use you,49
LUKE,Come on Why don't you take a look around You know what's about to happen what they're up against They could use a good pilot like you You're turning your back on them,33
HAN,What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it Besides attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage It's more like suicide,25
LUKE,All right Well take care of yourself Han I guess that's what you're best at isn't it,17
HAN,Hey Luke may the Force be with you,8
HAN,What're you lookin' at I know what I'm doing,9
LEIA,What's wrong,2
LUKE,Oh it's Han I don't know I really thought he'd change his mind,13
LEIA,He's got to follow his own path No one can choose it for him,14
LUKE,I only wish Ben were here,6
BIGGS,Luke I don't believe it How'd you get here are you going out with us,15

LUKE,Thank you sir I'll try,5
BIGGS,I've got to get aboard Listen you'll tell me your stories when we come back All right,17
LUKE,I told you I'd make it someday Biggs,8
BIGGS,You did all right It's going to be like old times Luke We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped,22
