GENERAL HUX,Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic,84
FINN,It was the Republic,4
FINN,The First Order they've done it Where's Rey,8
REY,What are you doing,4
REY,BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you,15

HAN,You changed your hair,4
LEIA,Same jacket,2

POE,No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn,13
FINN,Poe I need your help,5
POE,General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to,13
LEIA,And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life,22
FINN,Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner,11
LEIA,Han told me about the girl I'm sorry,8
POE,Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base,15
LEIA,We're desperate for anything you can tell us,8
FINN,That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast,12
LEIA,And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know,18
C-3PO,General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke,37
LEIA,I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home,19
HAN,Leia,1
LEIA,Don't do that,3
HAN,Do what She heads off,5
LEIA,Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO,7
C-3PO,Princesses,1
HAN,I'm trying to be helpful,5
LEIA,When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star,11
C-3PO,BB-8 You're wasting your time,5
C-3PO,It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data,17
HAN,Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him,20
LEIA,You think I want to forget him I want him back,11
HAN,There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him,13
LEIA,That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both,28
HAN,We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at,23
LEIA,We both did,3
HAN,We lost our son forever,5
LEIA,No,1
LEIA,He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You,16
HAN,If Luke couldn't reach him how could,7
LEIA,Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it,15
REY,Where am I,3
KYLO REN,You're my guest,3
REY,Where are the others,4
KYLO REN,You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea,20
KYLO REN,You still want to kill me,6
REY,That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask,12
KYLO REN,Tell me about the droid,5
REY,He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator,13
KYLO REN,He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger,37
KYLO REN,You know I can take whatever I want,8
KYLO REN, You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island,23
KYLO REN,And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you,16
REY,Get out of my head,5
KYLO REN,I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too,23
REY,I'm not giving you anything,5
KYLO REN,We'll see,2
REY, You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader,13
SNOKE,This scavenger resisted you,4
KYLO REN,She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows,11
SNOKE,And the droid,3
GENERAL HUX,Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us,9
GENERAL HUX,That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already,29
SNOKE,Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker,11
GENERAL HUX,We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system,13
SNOKE,Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon,13
KYLO REN,Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance,15
SNOKE,If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me,13
REY,You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open,13
REY,You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open,13
REY,You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open,13
