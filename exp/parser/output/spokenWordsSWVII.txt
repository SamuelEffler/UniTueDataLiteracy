Supreme Leader Snoke was explicitCapture the droid if we can butdestroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiersGeneral 
I won't have you question my methods 
They're obviously skilled atcommitting high treason PerhapsLeader Snoke should consider using aclone army 
My men are exceptionally trained --programmed from birth-- 
Then they should have no problemretrieving the droid Unharmed 
Careful Ren That your "personalinterests" not interfere with ordersfrom Leader Snoke

Niima Outpost 
Jakku That junkyard 
Thank you Junkyard 
Told ya we should've double-checkedthe Western Reaches 
I stole it from Unkar Plutt Hestole it from the Irving Boys whostole it from Ducain 
Who stole it from me Well youtell him Han Solo just stole backthe Millennium Falcon for good 
This is the Millennium Falcon You'reHan Solo 
I used to be 
Han Solo The Rebellion General 
No the smuggler 
Wasn't he a war hero 
This is the ship that made the KesselRun in fourteen parsecs 
Twelve Fourteen 
Hey Some moof-milker put acompressor on the ignition line 
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was amistake too puts too much stress on 
Stress on the hyperdrive--Chewie throw 'em in a pod we'lldrop them at the nearest inhabitedplanet 
Wait No we need your help 
My help 
This droid has to get to theResistance base as soon as possible 
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker 
You are the Han Solo that foughtwith the Rebellion You knew him

What's a Rathtar 
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre

He stays with me until I get ridof the gang then you can have himback and be on your way 
What about the Rathtars where areyou keeping them

Same thing I always do: talk my wayout of it 
Bala-Tik What's the problem 
Can you see them 
No 
You know you can't trust those littlefreaks How long've we known eachother

Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheapI spent that money 
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub 
Tasu Leech Good to see you

What was the second time 
First I've heard of it

This way 
Are you sure

I got one he's back there 
Watch the thrust we're goin' out ofhere at lightspeed -- 
From inside the hangar Is thateven possible 
I never ask that question until afterI've done it 
This is not how I thought this daywas gonna go angle the shields --Hang on back there 
No problem 
Come on baby don't let me down

Compressor

 Leading them to the last JediIf Skywalker returns the new Jediwill rise 
Supreme Leader I take fullresponsibility for th-- 
General Our strategy must nowchange

Go Oversee preparations 
Yes Supreme Leader 
There's been an awakening Have youfelt it 
Yes 
There's something more The droidwe seek is aboard the MillenniumFalcon In the hands of your fatherHan Solo

Even you master of the Knights ofRen have never faced such a test 
By the grace of your training Iwill not be seduced 
We shall see We shall see 
Electrical overload

The coolant's leaking 
Try transferring auxiliary power tothe secondary tank-- 
Secondary tank I got it

Go ahead 
This map's not complete It's justa piece Ever since Luke disappearedpeople have been looking for him 
Why'd he leave 
He was training a new generation ofJedi One boy an apprentice turnedagainst him destroyed it all Lukefelt responsible He walked awayfrom everything 
Do you know what happened to him 
There're a lot of rumors StoriesThe people who knew him the bestthink he went looking for the firstJedi temple 
The Jedi were real

What's this What are you doing 
Solo what is she doing 
I don't know but it ain't good 
If you live long enough you see thesame eyes in different people I'mlooking at the eyes of a man whowants to run 
You don't know a thing about meWhere I'm from What I've seen 
You don't know the First Order likeI do They'll slaughter us We allneed to run

The light It's always been thereIt will guide you The saber Takeit 
I'm never touching that again Idon't want any part of this 
Today is the end of the RepublicThe end of a regime that acquiescesto disorder At this very momentin a system far from here the NewRepublic LIES to the GALAXY whilesecretly supporting the treachery ofthe loathsome Resistance This fiercemachine which you have built uponwhich we stand will bring an end tothe Senate To their cherished fleetAll remaining systems will bow tothe First Order And will rememberthis as the last day of theRepublic 
 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done itWhere's Rey 
What are you doing 
BB-8 No you can't you have togo back you're too importantThey'll help you 
I've had this for ages 
Kept it locked away 
Where'd you get that 
A good question for another time 
Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out ofsight I'll try to fight 'em offI hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Nowgo 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let thesedogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluvapilot 
 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget thedroid We have what we need 
 
No no no no REY 
He took her Did you see that Hetook her She's gone 
Yeah yeah I know 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See-ThreepioYou probably don't recognize mebecause of the red armLook who it is Did you see whoOh Excuse me Prinuh GeneralSorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
 I saw him Leia I saw our sonHe was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happened I got thrown fromthe crash woke up at night noyou no ship nothing-- 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission FinnThat's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits youYou're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interruptthis is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That wasincredibly brave what you didRenouncing the First Order savingthis man's life -- 
Thank you ma'am but a friend ofmine was taken prisoner-- 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon thatdestroyed the Hosnian system Heworked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you cantell us 
That's where my friend was taken --I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can tohelp but first you must tell us allyou know 
General I regret to inform you butthis map recovered from BB-8 is onlypartially complete And even worseit matches no charted system onrecord We simply do not have enoughinformation to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish tothink that I could just find Lukeand bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do whatShe heads off 
AnythingFlummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don'tsay the Death Star 
 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 wouldhave the rest of the map in his backupdata 
Listen to me will you I know everytime you every time you look atme you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget him Iwant him back 
There was nothing we could've doneThere was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to trainwith Luke I just never should havesent him away That's when I losthim That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in ourown way I went back to the onlything I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark sideBut we can still save him MeYou 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jedi you're his fatherThere's still light in him I knowit 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors andthieves you call friendsYou'll be relieved to hear that Ihave no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being huntedby a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium driveand a thermal hyperscan vindicator -- 
He's carrying a section of anavigational chart We have therest recovered from archives of theEmpire We need the last pieceAnd somehow you convinced the droidto show it to you You A scavenger -- 
You know I can take whatever I want 
 You're so lonely so afraid toleaveAt night desperate to sleep youimagine an ocean I see it I seethe island 
And Han Solo You feel like he'sthe father you never had He would'vedisappointed you 
Get out of my head -- 
I know you've seen the map It's inthere and now you'll give it tome Don't be afraid I feel ittoo 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
 You you're afraid that youwill never be as strong as DarthVader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrainedbut stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuableto us 
That the girl was all we needed Asa result the droid has most likelybeen returned to the hands of theenemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyedbefore they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We trackedtheir reconnaissance ship to theIleenium system 
Good Then we will crush them onceand for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leader I can get the mapfrom the girl I just need yourguidance 
If what you say about this girl istrue bring her to me 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
And you will drop your weapon 
 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap'sreconnaissance flight confirms Finn'sreport 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun Asthe weapon is charged the sun isdrained until it disappears 
The First Order: they're chargingthe weapon again nowOur system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleetwe're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it upThere's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit thatoscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But Ihave to be there on the planet-- 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take outthe oscillator and we blow up theirbig gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitatorCome on Let's go Finn becareful with those - they'reexplosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I'vealways hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd missme 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it HuhSome of it wasgood 
 Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring himhome 
She's just beginning to test herpowers The longer it takes to findher the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractionalrefresh rate Keeps anythingtraveling slower than lightspeedfrom getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approachat lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She'sgoing to try to steal a ship to-- 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over thatridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were basedhere 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you knowhow to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxyis counting on us-- 
Solo we'll figure it out We'lluse the Force 
That's not how the Force works-- 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luckwe're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn andI'm in charge I'm in charge nowPhasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket offyour head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not goingto have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave herewithout her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trashcompactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send themin 
Roger base red squad blue squadtake my lead 
Almost in range Hit the targetdead center as many runs as we canget 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting itAnother bombing run Remember whenthat sun is gone that weapon willbe ready to fire But as long asthere's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow thatblast door I'll go in and drawfire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and tryto find Rey --The troopers'll be on our tailWe have to be ready for that There'san access tunnel that'll leads --Why are you doing that Why are youdoing this I'm trying to comeup with a plan 
Are you all right 
Yeah 
Good 
What happened did he hurt you 
Finn What are you doing here 
We came back for you 
What'd he say 
 That it was your idea 
Thank you 
How did you get away 
I can't explain it And you wouldn'tbelieve it 
Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leaveMy friend here has a bag full ofexplosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully chargedin 10 minutes It would take amiracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every othercolumn 
You're right That's a better ideaYou take the top 
Find them 
Ben 
Han Solo I've been waiting forthis day for a long time 
Take off that mask You don't needit 
What do you think you'll see if Ido 
The face of my son 
Your son is gone He was weak andfoolish like his father So Idestroyed him

Tal'ama parqual  
Parqual zatana

Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north you'll drown in the sand  
Don't follow me Town is that way No  
In the morning you go  
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board Comfortable  
Not really  
I'm impressed No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map  
Might wanna rethink your technique  
Where is it  
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you  
Where is it  
It's in a droid A BB unit  
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it  
I leave that to you  
Don't give up He still might show up Whoever it is you're waiting for Classified I know all about waiting  
For my family They'll be back One day Come on  
Last week they were a half portion each  
What about him  
Actually the droid's not for sale  
If what--  
You with the Resistance--  
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me  
You need a pilot  
We're gonna do this  
I am calm  
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot  
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire  
I can fix this  
I got it  
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far  
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp  
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot  
I saw it Hey what's your name  
FN-whaa  
Well I ain't using it FN huh Finn I'm gonna call you Finn That all right  
"Finn" Yeah "Finn" I like that I like that  
I'm Poe Poe Dameron  
Good to meet you Poe  
Good to meet you too Finn  
Use the ventral cannons  
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot  
Yes and he had help  
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was  
 The one from the village FN-  
Fire  
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it  
Hold on I see it  
Nice shot  
Where are you going  
We're going back to Jakku That's where  
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system  
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does  
What - a droid  
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white: one of a kind  
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important  
This one is pal  
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die  
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker  
Oh you gotta be kidding me I 
No prior signs of non-conformity  
Destroyed  
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage  
Poe Poe  
Poe POE  
 
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must  
How capable are your soldiers General  
I won't have you question my methods  
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army  
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed  
Careful Ren That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke  
I want that map For your sake I suggest you get it  
Water water water  
Awgh GAH  
 
What's your hurry thief  
What-- Thief  
OW HEY What  
The jacket This droid says you stole it  
I've had a pretty messed up day alright So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW Where'd you get it It belongs to his master  
It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right  
He was captured by the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed  
So you're with the Resistance  
Obviously Yes I am I'm with the Resistance yeah  
I've never met a Resistance fighter before  
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different  
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base  
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it  
Luke Skywalker I thought he was a myth  
What is it  
What are you doing  
Come on  
Come on BB-8  
Let go of me  
No we gotta move  
I know how to run without you holding my hand BB-8 stay close This way  
They're shooting at both of us  
Yeah they saw you with me You're marked  
Well thanks for that  
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick Does anyone have blasters around here  
Are you okay  
Stop taking my hand  
Hey  
Are you okay  
Yeah Follow me  
We can't outrun them  
We might in that quad-jumper  
We need a pilot

Great Whoa I can do this I can do this

Whoa Hey Oh Stay low Stay low  
Stay low It confuses their tracking  
BB-8 hold on  
 
What are you doing back there Are you ever gonna fire back  
I'm working on it Are the shields up  
Not so easy without a co-pilot  
Try sitting in this thing  
We need cover quick  
We're about to get some  
Damn it  
Come on come on  
Nice shot  
I'm getting pretty good at this  
The cannon's stuck in forward position I can't move it You gotta lose 'em  
Get ready  
Okay For what

Help me with this Quick  
Whoa What's going on  
The droid stole a freighter  
Anything else  
What girl  
It's the motivator Grab me a Harris wrench check in there  
How bad is it  
If we wanna live not good  
They're hunting for us now we gotta get outta this system  
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" if I'm taking you there I need to know  
This  
You gotta tell us where the base is  
Pilex driver hurry  
So where's your base  
Go on BB-8 tell her  
The Ileenium system  
Yeah the Ileenium system that's the one get us there as fast as you can  
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal I need the bonding tape hurry  
What about you  
I gotta get back to Jakku  
BACK TO JAKWhy does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku   
No that one No No The one I'm pointing to No NO NO If we don't patch it up the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas  
This  
Yes  
Hey Rey You're a pilot you can fly anywhere Why go back You got a family You got a boyfriend Cute boyfriend  
None of your business THAT'S WHY  
 That can't be good  
No it can't be  
 
Someone's locked onto us all controls are overridden  
Get off Get off See anything  
 Oh no  
It's the First Order  
What do we dothere must be  
You said poisonous gas  
Yeah but I fixed that  
Can you unfix it  
C'mon BB-8  
I got it  
Oooh  
I'm okay BB-8 get off me  
You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers  
Yeah Their masks filter out smoke not toxins  
Hurry  
I'm hurrying  
Chewie we're home  
Where are the others Where's the pilot  
I'm the pilot  
You  
No it's true: we're the only ones on board  
You can understand that thing  
And "that thing" can understand you too so watch it Come on outta there  
Where'd you get this ship  
Niima Outpost  
Jakku That junkyard  
Thank you Junkyard  
Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches  
I stole it from Unkar Plutt He stole it from the Irving Boys who stole it from Ducain  
Who stole it from me Well you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good  
This is the Millennium Falcon You're Han Solo  
I used to be  
Han Solo The Rebellion General  
No the smuggler  
Wasn't he a war hero  
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs  
Twelve Fourteen  
Hey Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line  
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was a mistake too puts too much stress on  
Stress on the hyperdriveChewie throw 'em in a pod we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet  
Wait No we need your help  
My help  
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible  
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker  
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion You knew him  
Yeah I knew him I knew Luke  
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten  
Wait a what Did you just say Rathtars Hey  
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you  
I'm hauling Rathtars  
Oh great It's the Guavian Death Gang they must've tracked us from Nantoon  
What's a Rathtar  
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre  
No  
Good  
I got three of 'em going to King Prana  
THREE How'd you get them on board  
I used to have a bigger crew  
Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon  
What about BB-8  
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way  
What about the Rathtars where are you keeping them  
There's one  
What are you gonna do  
Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it  
Bala-Tik What's the problem  
Can you see them  
No  
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other  
They have blasters  
A lot of 'em  
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money  
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub  
Tasu Leech Good to see you  
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before  
What was the second time  
First I've heard of it  
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs  
Close the blast doors from here  
Resetting the fuses should do it  
 I got a bad feeling about this  
Oh no  
Oh no what  
Wrong fuses  
This was a mistake  
Huge  
What do they look like  
They look like that  
This way  
Are you sure  
 
 
 
Finn  
It had me But the door--  
That was lucky  
I got the door Cover us  
Chewie You okay  
Wow Come on Come on  
Han  
You close the door behind us  
Hey where are you going  
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere  
I hate that guy  
And you could use a co-pilot  
I got one he's back there  
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed  
From inside the hangar Is that even possible  
I never ask that question until after I've done it  
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there  
No problem  
Come on baby don't let me down  
What  
Compressor  
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance  
 Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise  
Supreme Leader I take full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change  
The weapon It is ready I believe the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker  
Go Oversee preparations  
Yes Supreme Leader  
There's been an awakening Have you felt it  
Yes  
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo  
He means nothing to me  
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test  
By the grace of your training I will not be seduced  
We shall see We shall see  
Electrical overload  
I can fix that  
The coolant's leaking  
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tank I got it  
Chewie come on I need help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie  
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me  
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine  
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems  
What'd you do  
I by-passed the compressor  
Move Ball  
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest  
Good job kid And thanks  
You're welcome  
So fugitives huh  
The First Order wants the map  
Finn is with the Resistance  
Let's see whatcha got  
Go ahead  
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him  
Why'd he leave  
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsible He walked away from everything  
Do you know what happened to him  
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple  
The Jedi were real  
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light  
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop  
 I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy  
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here  
D'you just call me "Solo"  
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers  
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth  
Always  
You might need this  
I think I can handle myself  
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it  
You know how to use one of these  
Yeah you pull the trigger  
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name  
Rey  
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Rey A second mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon  
Are you offering me a job  
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much  
You're offering me a job  
I'm thinking about it  
Well  
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home  
Jakku  
I've already been away too long  
Chewie check out the ship as best you can  
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you  
Solo why are we here again  
To get your droid on a clean ship  
Clean  
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet  
We can trust her right  
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare  
At what  
Any of it  
Han Solo  
Hey Maz  
Where's my boyfriend  
Chewie's working on the Falcon  
I like that Wookiee I assume you need something Desperately Let's get to it  
Forgive me I feel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started  
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess  
Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia  
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home  
Leia doesn't want to see me  
Please we came here for your help  
What fight  
The only fight: against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us  
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized already I bet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing  
Solo what is she doing  
I don't know but it ain't good  
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run  
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen  
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run  
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear  
Finn  
Come with me  
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base  
I can't  
Keep it kid  
Who's the girl  
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim  
What are you doing  
Don't leave without me  
You can't just go I won't let you  
I'm not who you think I am  
Finn what are you talking about  
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper  
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever had I was ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me  
Don't go  
Take care of yourself Please  
What was that I shouldn't have gone in there  
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you  
I have to get back to Jakku  
Han told me Dear child I see your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back But there's someone who still could  
Luke  
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is ahead I am no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it  
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it  
I'm never touching that again I don't want any part of this  
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic  
 
It was the Republic  
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey  
What are you doing  
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you  
I've had this for ages  
Kept it locked away  
Where'd you get that  
A good question for another time  
Those beasts They're here  
Safety  
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too  
Come on Chewie  
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go  
I need a weapon  
You have one  
Hey can I try that  
I like this thing  
You okay Big deal  
Thanks  
It's the Resistance  
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you  
Quick  
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot  
 
The girl I've heard so much about  
The droid  
Where is it  
The map You've seen it  
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need  
 
No no no no REY  
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone  
Yeah yeah I know  
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly  
You changed your hair  
Same jacket  
No new jacket  
 I saw him Leia I saw our son He was here  
Poe Poe Dameron  
You're alive  
So are you  
What happened to you  
What happened I got thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him  
No no no It wasn't just me  
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket  
Oh here  
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn  
Poe I need your help  
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to  
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life  
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry  
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base  
We're desperate for anything you can tell us  
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast  
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know  
General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke  
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home  
Leia  
Don't do that  
Do what She heads off  
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO  
Princesses  
I'm trying to be helpful  
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star  
 
BB-8 You're wasting your time  
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data  
Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him  
You think I want to forget him I want him back  
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him  
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both  
We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at  
We both did  
We lost our son forever  
No  
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You  
If Luke couldn't reach him how could  
Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it  
Where am I  
You're my guest  
Where are the others  
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea  
You still want to kill me  
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask  
Tell me about the droid  
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator  
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger  
You know I can take whatever I want  
 You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island  
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you  
Get out of my head  
I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too  
I'm not giving you anything  
We'll see  
 You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader  
This scavenger resisted you  
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows  
And the droid  
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us  
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already  
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker  
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system  
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon  
Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance  
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
And you will drop your weapon  
 
Begin charging the weapon  
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report  
I wish that were the case Major  
This was the Death Star  
This is Starkiller Base  
So it's big  
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears  
The First Order: they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target  
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed  
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that  
Han's right  
There is one  
Precinct 47 Here  
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got  
We disable the shields  
I can do it  
I like this guy  
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there  
Han how  
If I told you you wouldn't like it  
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go  
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives  
Now you tell me  
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave  
That's what I did it So you'd miss me  
I did miss you  
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood  
 Pretty good  
Some things never change  
True You still drive me crazy  
If you see our son again bring him home  
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes  
How are we getting in  
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through  
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed  
Alright Chewie get ready  
And Now  
 
I get any higher they'll see us  
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo  
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way  
What was your job when you were based here  
Sanitation  
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields  
I don't I'm just here to get Rey  
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us--  
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force  
That's not how the Force works--  
Oh really you're cold  
Come on  
Report  
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields  
I have an idea about that  
Remember me  
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge  
Bring it down Bring it down  
Follow me  
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields  
Do it  
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey  
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her  
I disagree What do we do with her  
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor  
Yeah there is  
Thank the Maker  
Han did it Send them in  
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead  
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get  
Dispatch all squadrons  
Let's light it up  
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance  
Guys we got a lot of company  
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover  
You sure you're up for this  
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan  
Are you all right  
Yeah  
Good  
What happened did he hurt you  
Finn What are you doing here  
We came back for you  
What'd he say  
 That it was your idea  
Thank you  
How did you get away  
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it  
Escape now Hug later  
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em  
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now  
That girl knows her stuff  
We'll set the charges at every other column  
You're right That's a better idea You take the top  
Find them  
Ben  
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time  
Take off that mask You don't need it  
What do you think you'll see if I do  
The face of my son  
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him  
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive  
No The Supreme Leader is wise  
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true  
It's too late  
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you  
I'm being torn apart I want to be free of this pain  
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me  
Yes Anything  
Thank you  
Solo  
No no  
The Falcon's this way  
We're not done yet  
You're a monster

We'll see each other again I believe that Thank you my friend  
Rey

Well because of you now we have a chance The General's been after this for a long time  
We've got company  
You have to hide  
Come on BB-8 Hurry  
I see 'em  
You take this It's safer with you than it is with me You get as far away from here as you can Do you hear me I'll come back for you It will be alright  
Look how old you've become  
You know what I've come for  
The map to Skywalker We know you've found it and now you're going to give it to the First Order  
I'll show you the dark side  
You're so right  
So who talks first You talk first  
The old man gave it to you  
It's just very hard to understand you with all the  
Search him  
 Apparatus  
Put him on board  
Kill them all  
All right All right  
Tal'ama parqual  
Parqual zatana  
Shhhh  
That's just Teedo Wants you for parts He has no respect for anyone Your antenna's bent Where do you come from  
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north you'll drown in the sand  
Don't follow me Town is that way No  
In the morning you go  
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board Comfortable  
Not really  
I'm impressed No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map  
Might wanna rethink your technique  
Where is it  
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you  
Where is it  
It's in a droid A BB unit  
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it  
I leave that to you  
Don't give up He still might show up Whoever it is you're waiting for Classified I know all about waiting  
For my family They'll be back One day Come on  
Last week they were a half portion each  
What about him  
Actually the droid's not for sale  
If what--  
You with the Resistance--  
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me  
You need a pilot  
We're gonna do this  
I am calm  
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot  
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire  
I can fix this  
I got it  
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far  
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp  
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot  
I saw it Hey what's your name  
FN-whaa  
Well I ain't using it FN huh Finn I'm gonna call you Finn That all right  
"Finn" Yeah "Finn" I like that I like that  
I'm Poe Poe Dameron  
Good to meet you Poe  
Good to meet you too Finn  
Use the ventral cannons  
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot  
Yes and he had help  
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was  
 The one from the village FN-  
Fire  
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it  
Hold on I see it  
Nice shot  
Where are you going  
We're going back to Jakku That's where  
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system  
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does  
What - a droid  
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white: one of a kind  
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important  
This one is pal  
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die  
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker  
Oh you gotta be kidding me I 
No prior signs of non-conformity  
Destroyed  
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage  
Poe Poe  
Poe POE  
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must  
How capable are your soldiers General  
I won't have you question my methods  
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army  
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed  
Careful Ren That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke  
I want that map For your sake I suggest you get it  
Water water water  
Awgh GAH  
What's your hurry thief  
What-- Thief  
OW HEY What  
The jacket This droid says you stole it  
I've had a pretty messed up day alright So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW Where'd you get it It belongs to his master  
It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right  
He was captured by the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed  
So you're with the Resistance  
Obviously Yes I am I'm with the Resistance yeah  
I've never met a Resistance fighter before  
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different  
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base  
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it  
Luke Skywalker I thought he was a myth  
What is it  
What are you doing  
Come on  
Come on BB-8  
Let go of me  
No we gotta move  
I know how to run without you holding my hand BB-8 stay close This way  
They're shooting at both of us

Well thanks for that  
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick Does anyone have blasters around here  
Are you okay  
Stop taking my hand  
Hey

Try sitting in this thing  
We need cover quick

Damn it  
Come on come on  
Nice shot

The droid stole a freighter  
Anything else

It's the motivator Grab me a Harris wrench check in there  
How bad is it  
If we wanna live not good  
They're hunting for us now we gotta get outta this system  
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" if I'm taking you there I need to know  
This  
You gotta tell us where the base is  
Pilex driver hurry  
So where's your base  
Go on BB-8 tell her  
The Ileenium system  
Yeah the Ileenium system that's the one get us there as fast as you can  
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal I need the bonding tape hurry  
What about you  
I gotta get back to Jakku  
BACK TO JAKWhy does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku   
No that one No No The one I'm pointing to No NO NO If we don't patch it up the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas  
This  
Yes  
Hey Rey You're a pilot you can fly anywhere Why go back You got a family You got a boyfriend Cute boyfriend  
None of your business THAT'S WHY  
 That can't be good  
No it can't be  
Someone's locked onto us all controls are overridden  
Get off Get off See anything  
 Oh no  
It's the First Order  
What do we dothere must be  
You said poisonous gas  
Yeah but I fixed that  
Can you unfix it  
C'mon BB-8  
I got it  
Oooh  
I'm okay BB-8 get off me  
You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers  
Yeah Their masks filter out smoke not toxins  
Hurry  
I'm hurrying  
Chewie we're home  
Where are the others Where's the pilot  
I'm the pilot  
You  
No it's true: we're the only ones on board  
You can understand that thing  
And "that thing" can understand you too so watch it Come on outta there  
Where'd you get this ship  
Niima Outpost  
Jakku That junkyard  
Thank you Junkyard  
Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches  
I stole it from Unkar Plutt He stole it from the Irving Boys who stole it from Ducain  
Who stole it from me Well you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good  
This is the Millennium Falcon You're Han Solo  
I used to be  
Han Solo The Rebellion General  
No the smuggler  
Wasn't he a war hero  
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs  
Twelve Fourteen  
Hey Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line  
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was a mistake too puts too much stress on  
Stress on the hyperdriveChewie throw 'em in a pod we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet  
Wait No we need your help  
My help  
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible  
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker  
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion You knew him  
Yeah I knew him I knew Luke  
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten  
Wait a what Did you just say Rathtars Hey  
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you  
I'm hauling Rathtars  
Oh great It's the Guavian Death Gang they must've tracked us from Nantoon  
What's a Rathtar  
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre  
No  
Good  
I got three of 'em going to King Prana  
THREE How'd you get them on board  
I used to have a bigger crew  
Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon  
What about BB-8  
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way  
What about the Rathtars where are you keeping them  
There's one  
What are you gonna do  
Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it  
Bala-Tik What's the problem  
Can you see them  
No  
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other  
They have blasters  
A lot of 'em  
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money  
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub  
Tasu Leech Good to see you  
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before  
What was the second time  
First I've heard of it  
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs  
Close the blast doors from here  
Resetting the fuses should do it  
 I got a bad feeling about this  
Oh no  
Oh no what  
Wrong fuses  
This was a mistake  
Huge  
What do they look like  
They look like that  
This way  
Are you sure  
Finn  
It had me But the door--  
That was lucky  
I got the door Cover us  
Chewie You okay  
Wow Come on Come on  
Han  
You close the door behind us  
Hey where are you going  
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere  
I hate that guy  
And you could use a co-pilot  
I got one he's back there  
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed  
From inside the hangar Is that even possible  
I never ask that question until after I've done it  
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there  
No problem  
Come on baby don't let me down  
What  
Compressor  
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance  
 Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise  
Supreme Leader I take full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change  
The weapon It is ready I believe the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker  
Go Oversee preparations  
Yes Supreme Leader  
There's been an awakening Have you felt it  
Yes  
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo  
He means nothing to me  
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test  
By the grace of your training I will not be seduced  
We shall see We shall see  
Electrical overload  
I can fix that  
The coolant's leaking  
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tank I got it  
Chewie come on I need help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie  
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me  
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine  
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems  
What'd you do  
I by-passed the compressor  
Move Ball  
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest  
Good job kid And thanks  
You're welcome  
So fugitives huh  
The First Order wants the map  
Finn is with the Resistance  
Let's see whatcha got  
Go ahead  
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him  
Why'd he leave  
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsible He walked away from everything  
Do you know what happened to him  
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple  
The Jedi were real  
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light  
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop  
 I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy  
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here  
D'you just call me "Solo"  
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers  
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth  
Always  
You might need this  
I think I can handle myself  
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it  
You know how to use one of these  
Yeah you pull the trigger  
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name  
Rey  
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Rey A second mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon  
Are you offering me a job  
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much  
You're offering me a job  
I'm thinking about it  
Well  
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home  
Jakku  
I've already been away too long  
Chewie check out the ship as best you can  
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you  
Solo why are we here again  
To get your droid on a clean ship  
Clean  
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet  
We can trust her right  
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare  
At what  
Any of it  
Han Solo  
Hey Maz  
Where's my boyfriend  
Chewie's working on the Falcon  
I like that Wookiee I assume you need something Desperately Let's get to it  
Forgive me I feel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started  
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess  
Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia  
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home  
Leia doesn't want to see me  
Please we came here for your help  
What fight  
The only fight: against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us  
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized already I bet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing  
Solo what is she doing  
I don't know but it ain't good  
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run  
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen  
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run  
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear  
Finn  
Come with me  
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base  
I can't  
Keep it kid  
Who's the girl  
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim  
What are you doing  
Don't leave without me  
You can't just go I won't let you  
I'm not who you think I am  
Finn what are you talking about  
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper  
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever had I was ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me  
Don't go  
Take care of yourself Please  
What was that I shouldn't have gone in there  
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you  
I have to get back to Jakku  
Han told me Dear child I see your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back But there's someone who still could  
Luke  
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is ahead I am no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it  
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it  
I'm never touching that again I don't want any part of this  
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic  
It was the Republic  
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey  
What are you doing  
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you  
I've had this for ages  
Kept it locked away  
Where'd you get that  
A good question for another time  
Those beasts They're here  
Safety  
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too  
Come on Chewie  
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go  
I need a weapon  
You have one  
Hey can I try that  
I like this thing  
You okay Big deal  
Thanks  
It's the Resistance  
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you  
Quick  
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot  
The girl I've heard so much about  
The droid  
Where is it  
The map You've seen it  
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need  
No no no no REY  
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone  
Yeah yeah I know  
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly  
You changed your hair  
Same jacket  
No new jacket  
 I saw him Leia I saw our son He was here  
Poe Poe Dameron  
You're alive  
So are you  
What happened to you  
What happened I got thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him  
No no no It wasn't just me  
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket  
Oh here  
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn  
Poe I need your help  
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to  
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life  
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry  
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base  
We're desperate for anything you can tell us  
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast  
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know  
General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke  
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home  
Leia  
Don't do that  
Do what She heads off  
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO  
Princesses  
I'm trying to be helpful  
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star  
BB-8 You're wasting your time  
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data  
Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him  
You think I want to forget him I want him back  
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him  
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both  
We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at  
We both did  
We lost our son forever  
No  
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You  
If Luke couldn't reach him how could  
Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it  
Where am I  
You're my guest  
Where are the others  
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea  
You still want to kill me  
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask  
Tell me about the droid  
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator  
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger  
You know I can take whatever I want  
 You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island  
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you  
Get out of my head  
I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too  
I'm not giving you anything  
We'll see  
 You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader  
This scavenger resisted you  
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows  
And the droid  
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us  
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already  
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker  
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system  
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon  
Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance  
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
And you will drop your weapon  
Begin charging the weapon  
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report  
I wish that were the case Major  
This was the Death Star  
This is Starkiller Base  
So it's big  
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears  
The First Order: they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target  
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed  
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that  
Han's right  
There is one  
Precinct 47 Here  
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got  
We disable the shields  
I can do it  
I like this guy  
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there  
Han how  
If I told you you wouldn't like it  
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go  
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives  
Now you tell me  
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave  
That's what I did it So you'd miss me  
I did miss you  
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood  
 Pretty good  
Some things never change  
True You still drive me crazy  
If you see our son again bring him home  
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes  
How are we getting in  
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through  
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed  
Alright Chewie get ready  
And Now  
I get any higher they'll see us  
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo  
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way  
What was your job when you were based here  
Sanitation  
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields  
I don't I'm just here to get Rey  
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us--  
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force  
That's not how the Force works--  
Oh really you're cold  
Come on  
Report  
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields  
I have an idea about that  
Remember me  
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge  
Bring it down Bring it down  
Follow me  
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields  
Do it  
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey  
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her  
I disagree What do we do with her  
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor  
Yeah there is  
Thank the Maker  
Han did it Send them in  
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead  
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get  
Dispatch all squadrons  
Let's light it up  
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance  
Guys we got a lot of company  
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover  
You sure you're up for this  
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan  
Are you all right  
Yeah  
Good  
What happened did he hurt you  
Finn What are you doing here  
We came back for you  
What'd he say  
 That it was your idea  
Thank you  
How did you get away  
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it  
Escape now Hug later  
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em  
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now  
That girl knows her stuff  
We'll set the charges at every other column  
You're right That's a better idea You take the top  
Find them  
Ben  
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time  
Take off that mask You don't need it  
What do you think you'll see if I do  
The face of my son  
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him  
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive  
No The Supreme Leader is wise  
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true  
It's too late  
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you  
I'm being torn apart I want to be free of this pain  
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me  
Yes Anything  
Thank you  
Solo  
No no  
The Falcon's this way  
We're not done yet  
You're a monster  
It's just us now Han Solo can't save you  
Rey Rey Rey Rey Oh no Oh no no no

Luke  
Oh my dear friend How I've missed you  
We'll see each other again I believe that Thank you my friend  
Rey  
May the Force be with you  
Well because of you now we have a chance The General's been after this for a long time  
We've got company  
You have to hide  
Come on BB-8 Hurry  
I see 'em  
You take this It's safer with you than it is with me You get as far away from here as you can Do you hear me I'll come back for you It will be alright  
Look how old you've become  
You know what I've come for  
The map to Skywalker We know you've found it and now you're going to give it to the First Order  
I'll show you the dark side  
You're so right  
So who talks first You talk first  
The old man gave it to you  
It's just very hard to understand you with all the  
Search him  
 Apparatus  
Put him on board  
Kill them all  
All right All right  
Tal'ama parqual  
Parqual zatana  
Shhhh  
That's just Teedo Wants you for parts He has no respect for anyone Your antenna's bent Where do you come from  
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north you'll drown in the sand  
Don't follow me Town is that way No  
In the morning you go  
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board Comfortable  
Not really  
I'm impressed No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map  
Might wanna rethink your technique  
Where is it  
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you  
Where is it  
It's in a droid A BB unit  
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it  
I leave that to you  
Don't give up He still might show up Whoever it is you're waiting for Classified I know all about waiting  
For my family They'll be back One day Come on  
Last week they were a half portion each  
What about him  
Actually the droid's not for sale  
If what  
You with the Resistance  
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me  
You need a pilot  
We're gonna do this  
I am calm  
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot  
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire  
I can fix this  
I got it  
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far  
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp  
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot  
I saw it Hey what's your name  
FN-whaa  
Well I ain't using it FN huh Finn I'm gonna call you Finn That all right  
"Finn" Yeah "Finn" I like that I like that  
I'm Poe Poe Dameron  
Good to meet you Poe  
Good to meet you too Finn  
Use the ventral cannons  
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot  
Yes and he had help  
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was  
 The one from the village FN-  
Fire  
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it  
Hold on I see it  
Nice shot  
Where are you going  
We're going back to Jakku That's where  
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system  
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does  
What - a droid  
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white: one of a kind  
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important  
This one is pal  
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die  
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker  
Oh you gotta be kidding me I 
No prior signs of non-conformity  
Destroyed  
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage  
Poe Poe  
Poe POE  
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must  
How capable are your soldiers General  
I won't have you question my methods  
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army  
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed  
Careful Ren That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke  
I want that map For your sake I suggest you get it  
Water water water  
Awgh GAH  
What's your hurry thief  
What Thief  
OW HEY What  
The jacket This droid says you stole it  
I've had a pretty messed up day alright So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW Where'd you get it It belongs to his master  
It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right  
He was captured by the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed  
So you're with the Resistance  
Obviously Yes I am I'm with the Resistance yeah  
I've never met a Resistance fighter before  
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different  
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base  
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it  
Luke Skywalker I thought he was a myth  
What is it  
What are you doing  
Come on  
Come on BB-8  
Let go of me  
No we gotta move  
I know how to run without you holding my hand BB-8 stay close This way

Try sitting in this thing  
We need cover quick

Damn it  
Come on come on  
Nice shot

It's the motivator Grab me a Harris wrench check in there  
How bad is it  
If we wanna live not good  
They're hunting for us now we gotta get outta this system  
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" if I'm taking you there I need to know  
This  
You gotta tell us where the base is  
Pilex driver hurry  
So where's your base  
Go on BB-8 tell her  
The Ileenium system

I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal I need the bonding tape hurry  
What about you  
I gotta get back to Jakku  
BACK TO JAK Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku   
No that one No No The one I'm pointing to No NO NO If we don't patch it up the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas  
This  
Yes  
Hey Rey You're a pilot you can fly anywhere Why go back You got a family You got a boyfriend Cute boyfriend  
None of your business THAT'S WHY  
 That can't be good  
No it can't be  
Someone's locked onto us all controls are overridden  
Get off Get off See anything

Hurry  
I'm hurrying  
Chewie we're home  
Where are the others Where's the pilot  
I'm the pilot  
You  
No it's true: we're the only ones on board  
You can understand that thing  
And "that thing" can understand you too so watch it Come on outta there  
Where'd you get this ship  
Niima Outpost  
Jakku That junkyard  
Thank you Junkyard  
Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches  
I stole it from Unkar Plutt He stole it from the Irving Boys who stole it from Ducain  
Who stole it from me Well you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good  
This is the Millennium Falcon You're Han Solo  
I used to be  
Han Solo The Rebellion General  
No the smuggler  
Wasn't he a war hero  
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs  
Twelve Fourteen  
Hey Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line  
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was a mistake too puts too much stress on  
Stress on the hyperdriveChewie throw 'em in a pod we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet  
Wait No we need your help  
My help  
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible  
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker  
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion You knew him  
Yeah I knew him I knew Luke  
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten  
Wait a what Did you just say Rathtars Hey  
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you  
I'm hauling Rathtars  
Oh great It's the Guavian Death Gang they must've tracked us from Nantoon  
What's a Rathtar  
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre  
No  
Good  
I got three of 'em going to King Prana  
THREE How'd you get them on board  
I used to have a bigger crew  
Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon  
What about BB-8  
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way  
What about the Rathtars where are you keeping them  
There's one  
What are you gonna do  
Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it  
Bala-Tik What's the problem  
Can you see them  
No  
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other  
They have blasters  
A lot of 'em  
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money  
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub  
Tasu Leech Good to see you  
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before  
What was the second time  
First I've heard of it  
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs  
Close the blast doors from here  
Resetting the fuses should do it  
 I got a bad feeling about this  
Oh no  
Oh no what  
Wrong fuses  
This was a mistake  
Huge  
What do they look like  
They look like that  
This way  
Are you sure  
Finn  
It had me But the door  
That was lucky  
I got the door Cover us  
Chewie You okay  
Wow Come on Come on  
Han  
You close the door behind us  
Hey where are you going  
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere  
I hate that guy  
And you could use a co-pilot  
I got one he's back there  
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed  
From inside the hangar Is that even possible  
I never ask that question until after I've done it  
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there  
No problem  
Come on baby don't let me down  
What  
Compressor  
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance  
 Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise  
Supreme Leader I take full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change  
The weapon It is ready I believe the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker  
Go Oversee preparations  
Yes Supreme Leader  
There's been an awakening Have you felt it  
Yes  
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo  
He means nothing to me  
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test  
By the grace of your training I will not be seduced  
We shall see We shall see  
Electrical overload  
I can fix that  
The coolant's leaking  
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tank I got it  
Chewie come on I need help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie  
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me  
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine  
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems  
What'd you do  
I by-passed the compressor  
Move Ball  
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest  
Good job kid And thanks  
You're welcome  
So fugitives huh  
The First Order wants the map  
Finn is with the Resistance  
Let's see whatcha got  
Go ahead  
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him  
Why'd he leave  
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsible He walked away from everything  
Do you know what happened to him  
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple  
The Jedi were real  
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light  
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop  
 I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy  
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here  
D'you just call me "Solo"  
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers  
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth  
Always  
You might need this  
I think I can handle myself  
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it  
You know how to use one of these  
Yeah you pull the trigger  
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name  
Rey  
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Rey A second mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon  
Are you offering me a job  
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much  
You're offering me a job  
I'm thinking about it  
Well  
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home  
Jakku  
I've already been away too long  
Chewie check out the ship as best you can  
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you  
Solo why are we here again  
To get your droid on a clean ship  
Clean  
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet  
We can trust her right  
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare  
At what  
Any of it  
Han Solo  
Hey Maz  
Where's my boyfriend  
Chewie's working on the Falcon  
I like that Wookiee I assume you need something Desperately Let's get to it  
Forgive me I feel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started  
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess  
Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia  
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home  
Leia doesn't want to see me  
Please we came here for your help  
What fight  
The only fight: against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us  
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized already I bet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing  
Solo what is she doing  
I don't know but it ain't good  
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run  
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen  
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run  
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear  
Finn  
Come with me  
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base  
I can't  
Keep it kid  
Who's the girl  
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim  
What are you doing  
Don't leave without me  
You can't just go I won't let you  
I'm not who you think I am  
Finn what are you talking about  
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper  
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever had I was ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me  
Don't go  
Take care of yourself Please  
What was that I shouldn't have gone in there  
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you  
I have to get back to Jakku  
Han told me Dear child I see your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back But there's someone who still could  
Luke  
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is ahead I am no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it  
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it  
I'm never touching that again I don't want any part of this  
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic  
It was the Republic  
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey  
What are you doing  
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you  
I've had this for ages  
Kept it locked away  
Where'd you get that  
A good question for another time  
Those beasts They're here  
Safety  
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too  
Come on Chewie  
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go  
I need a weapon  
You have one  
Hey can I try that  
I like this thing  
You okay Big deal  
Thanks  
It's the Resistance  
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you  
Quick  
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot  
The girl I've heard so much about  
The droid  
Where is it  
The map You've seen it  
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need  
No no no no REY  
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone  
Yeah yeah I know  
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly  
You changed your hair  
Same jacket  
No new jacket  
 I saw him Leia I saw our son He was here  
Poe Poe Dameron  
You're alive  
So are you  
What happened to you  
What happened I got thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him  
No no no It wasn't just me  
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket  
Oh here  
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn  
Poe I need your help  
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to  
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life  
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry  
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base  
We're desperate for anything you can tell us  
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast  
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know  
General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke  
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home  
Leia  
Don't do that  
Do what She heads off  
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO  
Princesses  
I'm trying to be helpful  
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star  
BB-8 You're wasting your time  
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data  
Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him  
You think I want to forget him I want him back  
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him  
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both  
We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at  
We both did  
We lost our son forever  
No  
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You  
If Luke couldn't reach him how could  
Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it  
Where am I  
You're my guest  
Where are the others  
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea  
You still want to kill me  
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask  
Tell me about the droid  
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator  
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger  
You know I can take whatever I want  
 You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island  
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you  
Get out of my head  
I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too  
I'm not giving you anything  
We'll see  
 You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader  
This scavenger resisted you  
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows  
And the droid  
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us  
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already  
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker  
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system  
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon  
Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance  
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open  
And you will drop your weapon  
Begin charging the weapon  
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report  
I wish that were the case Major  
This was the Death Star  
This is Starkiller Base  
So it's big  
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears  
The First Order: they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target  
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed  
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that  
Han's right  
There is one  
Precinct 47 Here  
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got  
We disable the shields  
I can do it  
I like this guy  
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there  
Han how  
If I told you you wouldn't like it  
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go  
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives  
Now you tell me  
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave  
That's what I did it So you'd miss me  
I did miss you  
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood  
 Pretty good  
Some things never change  
True You still drive me crazy  
If you see our son again bring him home  
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes  
How are we getting in  
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through  
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed  
Alright Chewie get ready  
And Now  
I get any higher they'll see us  
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo  
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way  
What was your job when you were based here  
Sanitation  
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields  
I don't I'm just here to get Rey  
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us  
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force  
That's not how the Force works  
Oh really you're cold  
Come on  
Report  
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields  
I have an idea about that  
Remember me  
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge  
Bring it down Bring it down  
Follow me  
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields  
Do it  
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey  
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her  
I disagree What do we do with her  
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor  
Yeah there is  
Thank the Maker  
Han did it Send them in  
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead  
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get  
Dispatch all squadrons  
Let's light it up  
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance  
Guys we got a lot of company  
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover  
You sure you're up for this  
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan  
Are you all right  
Yeah  
Good  
What happened did he hurt you  
Finn What are you doing here  
We came back for you  
What'd he say  
 That it was your idea  
Thank you  
How did you get away  
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it  
Escape now Hug later  
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em  
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now  
That girl knows her stuff  
We'll set the charges at every other column  
You're right That's a better idea You take the top  
Find them  
Ben  
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time  
Take off that mask You don't need it  
What do you think you'll see if I do  
The face of my son  
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him  
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive  
No The Supreme Leader is wise  
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true  
It's too late  
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you  
I'm being torn apart I want to be free of this pain  
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me  
Yes Anything  
Thank you  
Solo  
No no  
The Falcon's this way  
We're not done yet  
You're a monster  
It's just us now Han Solo can't save you  
Rey Rey Rey Rey Oh no Oh no no no

Supreme Leader Snoke was explicitCapture the droid if we can butdestroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiersGeneral

You don't know a thing about meWhere I'm from What I've seen 
You don't know the First Order likeI do They'll slaughter us We allneed to run

Today is the end of the RepublicThe end of a regime that acquiescesto disorder At this very momentin a system far from here the NewRepublic LIES to the GALAXY whilesecretly supporting the treachery ofthe loathsome Resistance This fiercemachine which you have built uponwhich we stand will bring an end tothe Senate To their cherished fleetAll remaining systems will bow tothe First Order And will rememberthis as the last day of theRepublic 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done itWhere's Rey 
What are you doing 
BB-8 No you can't you have togo back you're too importantThey'll help you 
I've had this for ages

A good question for another time 
Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out ofsight I'll try to fight 'em offI hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Nowgo 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let thesedogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluvapilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget thedroid We have what we need 
No no no no REY 
He took her Did you see that Hetook her She's gone 
Yeah yeah I know 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See-ThreepioYou probably don't recognize mebecause of the red armLook who it is Did you see whoOh Excuse me Prinuh GeneralSorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
 I saw him Leia I saw our sonHe was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happened I got thrown fromthe crash woke up at night noyou no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission FinnThat's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits youYou're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interruptthis is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That wasincredibly brave what you didRenouncing the First Order savingthis man's life  
Thank you ma'am but a friend ofmine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon thatdestroyed the Hosnian system Heworked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you cantell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can tohelp but first you must tell us allyou know 
General I regret to inform you butthis map recovered from BB-8 is onlypartially complete And even worseit matches no charted system onrecord We simply do not have enoughinformation to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish tothink that I could just find Lukeand bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do whatShe heads off 
AnythingFlummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don'tsay the Death Star 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 wouldhave the rest of the map in his backupdata 
Listen to me will you I know everytime you every time you look atme you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget him Iwant him back 
There was nothing we could've doneThere was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to trainwith Luke I just never should havesent him away That's when I losthim That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in ourown way I went back to the onlything I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark sideBut we can still save him MeYou 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jedi you're his fatherThere's still light in him I knowit 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors andthieves you call friendsYou'll be relieved to hear that Ihave no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being huntedby a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium driveand a thermal hyperscan vindicator  
He's carrying a section of anavigational chart We have therest recovered from archives of theEmpire We need the last pieceAnd somehow you convinced the droidto show it to you You A scavenger  
You know I can take whatever I want 
 You're so lonely so afraid toleaveAt night desperate to sleep youimagine an ocean I see it I seethe island 
And Han Solo You feel like he'sthe father you never had He would'vedisappointed you 
Get out of my head  
I know you've seen the map It's inthere and now you'll give it tome Don't be afraid I feel ittoo 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
 You you're afraid that youwill never be as strong as DarthVader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrainedbut stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuableto us 
That the girl was all we needed Asa result the droid has most likelybeen returned to the hands of theenemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyedbefore they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We trackedtheir reconnaissance ship to theIleenium system 
Good Then we will crush them onceand for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leader I can get the mapfrom the girl I just need yourguidance 
If what you say about this girl istrue bring her to me 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap'sreconnaissance flight confirms Finn'sreport 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun Asthe weapon is charged the sun isdrained until it disappears 
The First Order: they're chargingthe weapon again nowOur system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleetwe're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it upThere's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit thatoscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But Ihave to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take outthe oscillator and we blow up theirbig gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitatorCome on Let's go Finn becareful with those - they'reexplosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I'vealways hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd missme 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it HuhSome of it wasgood 
 Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring himhome 
She's just beginning to test herpowers The longer it takes to findher the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractionalrefresh rate Keeps anythingtraveling slower than lightspeedfrom getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approachat lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She'sgoing to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over thatridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were basedhere 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you knowhow to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxyis counting on us 
Solo we'll figure it out We'lluse the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luckwe're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn andI'm in charge I'm in charge nowPhasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket offyour head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not goingto have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave herewithout her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trashcompactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send themin 
Roger base red squad blue squadtake my lead 
Almost in range Hit the targetdead center as many runs as we canget 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting itAnother bombing run Remember whenthat sun is gone that weapon willbe ready to fire But as long asthere's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow thatblast door I'll go in and drawfire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and tryto find Rey The troopers'll be on our tailWe have to be ready for that There'san access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are youdoing this I'm trying to comeup with a plan 
Are you all right

Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leaveMy friend here has a bag full ofexplosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully chargedin 10 minutes It would take amiracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every othercolumn 
You're right That's a better ideaYou take the top

How capable are your soldiersGeneral

Today is the end of the RepublicThe end of a regime that acquiescesto disorder At this very momentin a system far from here the NewRepublic LIES to the GALAXY whilesecretly supporting the treachery ofthe loathsome Resistance This fiercemachine which you have built uponwhich we stand will bring an end tothe Senate To their cherished fleetAll remaining systems will bow tothe First Order And will rememberthis as the last day of theRepublic 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done itWhere's Rey

BB-8 No you can't you have togo back you're too importantThey'll help you

Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out ofsight I'll try to fight 'em offI hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Nowgo 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let thesedogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluvapilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget thedroid We have what we need 
No no no no REY 
He took her Did you see that Hetook her She's gone 
Yeah yeah I know 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See-ThreepioYou probably don't recognize mebecause of the red armLook who it is Did you see whoOh Excuse me Prinuh GeneralSorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
 I saw him Leia I saw our sonHe was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happened I got thrown fromthe crash woke up at night noyou no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission FinnThat's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits youYou're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interruptthis is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That wasincredibly brave what you didRenouncing the First Order savingthis man's life  
Thank you ma'am but a friend ofmine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon thatdestroyed the Hosnian system Heworked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you cantell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can tohelp but first you must tell us allyou know 
General I regret to inform you butthis map recovered from BB-8 is onlypartially complete And even worseit matches no charted system onrecord We simply do not have enoughinformation to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish tothink that I could just find Lukeand bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do whatShe heads off 
AnythingFlummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don'tsay the Death Star 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 wouldhave the rest of the map in his backupdata 
Listen to me will you I know everytime you every time you look atme you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget him Iwant him back 
There was nothing we could've doneThere was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to trainwith Luke I just never should havesent him away That's when I losthim That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in ourown way I went back to the onlything I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark sideBut we can still save him MeYou 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jedi you're his fatherThere's still light in him I knowit 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors andthieves you call friendsYou'll be relieved to hear that Ihave no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being huntedby a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium driveand a thermal hyperscan vindicator  
He's carrying a section of anavigational chart We have therest recovered from archives of theEmpire We need the last pieceAnd somehow you convinced the droidto show it to you You A scavenger  
You know I can take whatever I want 
 You're so lonely so afraid toleaveAt night desperate to sleep youimagine an ocean I see it I seethe island 
And Han Solo You feel like he'sthe father you never had He would'vedisappointed you 
Get out of my head  
I know you've seen the map It's inthere and now you'll give it tome Don't be afraid I feel ittoo 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
 You you're afraid that youwill never be as strong as DarthVader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrainedbut stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuableto us 
That the girl was all we needed Asa result the droid has most likelybeen returned to the hands of theenemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyedbefore they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We trackedtheir reconnaissance ship to theIleenium system 
Good Then we will crush them onceand for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leader I can get the mapfrom the girl I just need yourguidance 
If what you say about this girl istrue bring her to me 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cell with the dooropen 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap'sreconnaissance flight confirms Finn'sreport 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun Asthe weapon is charged the sun isdrained until it disappears 
The First Order they're chargingthe weapon again nowOur system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleetwe're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it upThere's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit thatoscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But Ihave to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take outthe oscillator and we blow up theirbig gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitatorCome on Let's go Finn becareful with those - they'reexplosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I'vealways hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd missme 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it HuhSome of it wasgood 
 Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring himhome 
She's just beginning to test herpowers The longer it takes to findher the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractionalrefresh rate Keeps anythingtraveling slower than lightspeedfrom getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approachat lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She'sgoing to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over thatridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were basedhere 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you knowhow to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxyis counting on us 
Solo we'll figure it out We'lluse the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luckwe're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn andI'm in charge I'm in charge nowPhasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket offyour head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not goingto have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave herewithout her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trashcompactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send themin 
Roger base red squad blue squadtake my lead 
Almost in range Hit the targetdead center as many runs as we canget 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting itAnother bombing run Remember whenthat sun is gone that weapon willbe ready to fire But as long asthere's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow thatblast door I'll go in and drawfire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and tryto find Rey The troopers'll be on our tailWe have to be ready for that There'san access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are youdoing this I'm trying to comeup with a plan 
Are you all right

Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leaveMy friend here has a bag full ofexplosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully chargedin 10 minutes It would take amiracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every othercolumn 
You're right That's a better ideaYou take the top 
Find them 
Ben

You're so right 
So who talks first You talk first

Tal'ama parqual 
Parqual zatana

That's just Teedo Wants you for parts He has no respect for anyone Your antenna's bent Where do you come from 
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north you'll drown in the sand 
Don't follow me Town is that way No 
In the morning you go 
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board Comfortable 
Not really 
I'm impressed No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map 
Might wanna rethink your technique 
Where is it 
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you 
Where is it 
It's in a droid A BB unit 
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it 
I leave that to you 
Don't give up He still might show up Whoever it is you're waiting for Classified I know all about waiting 
For my family They'll be back One day Come on 
Last week they were a half portion each 
What about him 
Actually the droid's not for sale 
If what 
You with the Resistance 
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me 
You need a pilot 
We're gonna do this 
I am calm 
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot 
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire 
I can fix this 
I got it 
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far 
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp 
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot 
I saw it Hey what's your name 
FN-whaa 
Well I ain't using it FN huh Finn I'm gonna call you Finn That all right 
"Finn" Yeah "Finn" I like that I like that 
I'm Poe Poe Dameron 
Good to meet you Poe 
Good to meet you too Finn 
Use the ventral cannons 
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot 
Yes and he had help 
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was 
 The one from the village FN- 
Fire 
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it 
Hold on I see it 
Nice shot 
Where are you going 
We're going back to Jakku That's where 
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system 
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does 
What - a droid 
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white one of a kind 
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important 
This one is pal 
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die 
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker 
Oh you gotta be kidding me I 
No prior signs of non-conformity 
Destroyed 
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage 
Poe Poe 
Poe POE 
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiers General 
I won't have you question my methods 
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army 
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed 
Careful Ren That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke 
I want that map For your sake I suggest you get it 
Water water water 
Awgh GAH 
What's your hurry thief 
What Thief 
OW HEY What 
The jacket This droid says you stole it 
I've had a pretty messed up day alright So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW Where'd you get it It belongs to his master 
It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right 
He was captured by the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed 
So you're with the Resistance 
Obviously Yes I am I'm with the Resistance yeah 
I've never met a Resistance fighter before 
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different 
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base 
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it 
Luke Skywalker I thought he was a myth 
What is it 
What are you doing 
Come on 
Come on BB-8 
Let go of me 
No we gotta move 
I know how to run without you holding my hand BB-8 stay close This way 
They're shooting at both of us

Well thanks for that 
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick Does anyone have blasters around here 
Are you okay 
Stop taking my hand 
Hey

How bad is it 
If we wanna live not good 
They're hunting for us now we gotta get outta this system 
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" if I'm taking you there I need to know 
This 
You gotta tell us where the base is 
Pilex driver hurry 
So where's your base 
Go on BB-8 tell her

BACK TO JAK Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku  
No that one No No The one I'm pointing to No NO NO If we don't patch it up the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas 
This 
Yes 
Hey Rey You're a pilot you can fly anywhere Why go back You got a family You got a boyfriend Cute boyfriend 
None of your business THAT'S WHY 
 That can't be good

Hurry 
I'm hurrying 
Chewie we're home

I'm the pilot 
You 
No it's true we're the only ones on board 
You can understand that thing 
And "that thing" can understand you too so watch it Come on outta there 
Where'd you get this ship 
Niima Outpost 
Jakku That junkyard 
Thank you Junkyard 
Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches 
I stole it from Unkar Plutt He stole it from the Irving Boys who stole it from Ducain 
Who stole it from me Well you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good 
This is the Millennium Falcon You're Han Solo 
I used to be 
Han Solo The Rebellion General 
No the smuggler 
Wasn't he a war hero 
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs 
Twelve Fourteen 
Hey Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line 
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was a mistake too puts too much stress on 
Stress on the hyperdriveChewie throw 'em in a pod we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet 
Wait No we need your help 
My help 
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible 
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker 
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion You knew him 
Yeah I knew him I knew Luke 
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten 
Wait a what Did you just say Rathtars Hey 
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you 
I'm hauling Rathtars 
Oh great It's the Guavian Death Gang they must've tracked us from Nantoon 
What's a Rathtar 
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre 
No 
Good 
I got three of 'em going to King Prana 
THREE How'd you get them on board 
I used to have a bigger crew 
Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon 
What about BB-8 
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way 
What about the Rathtars where are you keeping them 
There's one 
What are you gonna do 
Same thing I always do talk my way out of it 
Bala-Tik What's the problem 
Can you see them 
No 
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other 
They have blasters 
A lot of 'em 
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money 
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub 
Tasu Leech Good to see you 
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before 
What was the second time 
First I've heard of it 
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs 
Close the blast doors from here 
Resetting the fuses should do it 
 I got a bad feeling about this 
Oh no 
Oh no what 
Wrong fuses 
This was a mistake 
Huge 
What do they look like 
They look like that 
This way 
Are you sure 
Finn 
It had me But the door 
That was lucky 
I got the door Cover us 
Chewie You okay 
Wow Come on Come on 
Han 
You close the door behind us 
Hey where are you going 
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere 
I hate that guy 
And you could use a co-pilot 
I got one he's back there 
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed 
From inside the hangar Is that even possible 
I never ask that question until after I've done it 
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there 
No problem 
Come on baby don't let me down 
What 
Compressor 
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance 
 Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise 
Supreme Leader I take full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change 
The weapon It is ready I believe the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker 
Go Oversee preparations 
Yes Supreme Leader 
There's been an awakening Have you felt it 
Yes 
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo 
He means nothing to me 
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test 
By the grace of your training I will not be seduced 
We shall see We shall see 
Electrical overload 
I can fix that 
The coolant's leaking 
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tank I got it 
Chewie come on I need help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie 
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me 
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine 
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems 
What'd you do 
I by-passed the compressor 
Move Ball 
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest 
Good job kid And thanks 
You're welcome 
So fugitives huh 
The First Order wants the map 
Finn is with the Resistance 
Let's see whatcha got 
Go ahead 
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him 
Why'd he leave 
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsible He walked away from everything 
Do you know what happened to him 
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple 
The Jedi were real 
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light 
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop 
 I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy 
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here 
D'you just call me "Solo" 
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers 
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth 
Always 
You might need this 
I think I can handle myself 
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it 
You know how to use one of these 
Yeah you pull the trigger 
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name 
Rey 
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Rey A second mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon 
Are you offering me a job 
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much 
You're offering me a job 
I'm thinking about it 
Well 
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home 
Jakku 
I've already been away too long 
Chewie check out the ship as best you can 
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you 
Solo why are we here again 
To get your droid on a clean ship 
Clean 
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet 
We can trust her right 
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare 
At what 
Any of it 
Han Solo 
Hey Maz 
Where's my boyfriend 
Chewie's working on the Falcon 
I like that Wookiee I assume you need something Desperately Let's get to it 
Forgive me I feel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started 
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess 
Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia 
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home 
Leia doesn't want to see me 
Please we came here for your help 
What fight 
The only fight against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us 
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized already I bet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing 
Solo what is she doing 
I don't know but it ain't good 
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run 
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen 
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run 
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear 
Finn 
Come with me 
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base 
I can't 
Keep it kid 
Who's the girl 
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim 
What are you doing 
Don't leave without me 
You can't just go I won't let you 
I'm not who you think I am 
Finn what are you talking about 
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper 
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever had I was ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me 
Don't go 
Take care of yourself Please 
What was that I shouldn't have gone in there 
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you 
I have to get back to Jakku 
Han told me Dear child I see your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back But there's someone who still could 
Luke 
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is ahead I am no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it 
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it 
I'm never touching that again I don't want any part of this 
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey 
What are you doing 
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you 
I've had this for ages 
Kept it locked away 
Where'd you get that 
A good question for another time 
Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need 
No no no no REY 
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone 
Yeah yeah I know 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
 I saw him Leia I saw our son He was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happened I got thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life 
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you can tell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know 
General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do what She heads off 
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data 
Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget him I want him back 
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator 
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger 
You know I can take whatever I want 
 You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island 
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you 
Get out of my head 
I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
 You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us 
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system 
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance 
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears 
The First Order they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd miss me 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood 
 Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring him home 
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were based here 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us 
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send them in 
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead 
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan 
Are you all right 
Yeah 
Good 
What happened did he hurt you 
Finn What are you doing here 
We came back for you 
What'd he say 
 That it was your idea 
Thank you 
How did you get away 
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it 
Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every other column 
You're right That's a better idea You take the top 
Find them 
Ben 
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time 
Take off that mask You don't need it 
What do you think you'll see if I do 
The face of my son 
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him 
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive 
No The Supreme Leader is wise 
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true 
It's too late 
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you 
I'm being torn apart I want to be free of this pain 
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me 
Yes Anything 
Thank you 
Solo 
No no 
The Falcon's this way 
We're not done yet 
You're a monster 
It's just us now Han Solo can't save you 
Rey Rey Rey Rey Oh no Oh no no no

Destroyed 
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage 
PoePoe 
PoePOE 
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicitCapture the droid if we canbut destroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiersGeneral 
I won't have you question my methods 
They're obviously skilled at committing high treasonPerhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army 
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droidUnharmed

Today is the end of the RepublicThe end of a regime that acquiesces to disorderAt this very momentin a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome ResistanceThis fierce machine which you have builtupon which we standwill bring an end to the SenateTo their cherished fleetAll remaining systems will bow to the First OrderAnd will remember thisas the last day of the Republic 
It was the Republic 
The First Orderthey've done itWhere's Rey

Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you 
Quick 
WoohooYEAHThat's one helluva pilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The mapYou've seen it 
Pull the division outForget the droidWe have what we need 
NonononoREY 
He took herDid you see thatHe took herShe's gone 
YeahyeahI know 
GoodnessHan SoloIt is ISee- ThreepioYou probably don't recognize me because of the red armLook who it isDid you see whoOhExcuse mePrinuhGeneralSorryCome alongBB-8Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
Nonew jacket 
I saw himLeiaI saw our sonHe was here 
PoePoe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happenedI got thrown from the crashwoke up at night no youno shipnothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
NononoIt wasn't just me 
You completed my missionFinnThat's my jacket 
Oh here 
NononoKeep itIt suits youYou're a good manFinn 
Poe I need your help 
General OrganaSorry to interruptthis is Finnhe needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to himThat was incredibly bravewhat you didRenouncing the First Ordersaving this man's life 
Thank youma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girlI'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian systemHe worked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you can tell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get therefast 
And I will do everything I can to helpbut first you must tell us all you know 
GeneralI regret to inform youbut this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially completeAnd even worseit matches no charted system on recordWe simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do whatShe heads off 
AnythingFlummoxedHan follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever helpAnd don't say the Death Star 
BB-8You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data 
Listen to mewill youI know every time youevery time you look at meyou're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget himI want him back 
There was nothing we could've doneThere was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to train with LukeI just never should have sent him awayThat's when I lost himThat's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in our own wayI went back to the only thing I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our sonforever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark sideBut we can still save himMeYou 
If Luke couldn't reach himhow could 
Luke is a Jediyou're his fatherThere's still light in himI know it 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murdererstraitors and thieves you call friendsYou'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator 
He's carrying a section of a navigational chartWe have the restrecovered from archives of the EmpireWe need the last pieceAnd somehowyou convinced the droid to show it to youYouA scavenger 
You know I can take whatever I want 
You're so lonelyso afraid to leaveAt nightdesperate to sleepyou imagine an oceanI see it I see the island 
And Han SoloYou feel like he's the father you never hadHe would've disappointed you 
Get out of my head 
I know you've seen the mapIt's in thereand now you'll give it to meDon't be afraidI feel it too 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
Youyou're afraidthat you will never be as strong asDarth Vader 
This scavengerresisted you 
She's strong with the Forceuntrained butstronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us 
That the girl was all we neededAs a resultthe droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemyThey may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker 
We have their locationWe tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system 
GoodThen we will crush them once and for allPrepare the weapon 
Supreme LeaderI can get the map from the girlI just need your guidance 
If what you say about this girl is truebring her to me 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cellwith the door open 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cellwith the door open 
You will remove these restraintsAnd leave this cellwith the door open 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report 
I wish that were the caseMajor 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sunAs the weapon is chargedthe sun is drained until it disappears 
The First Orderthey're charging the weapon againnowOur system is the next target 
Oh myWithout the Republic fleetwe're doomed 
Okayhow do we blow it upThere's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shieldsBut I have to be thereon the planet 
We'll get you there 
Hanhow 
If I told youyou wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shieldstake out the oscillator and we blow up their big gunAll rightLet's go 
Chewiecheck that donal capitatorCome onLet's goFinnbe careful with those - they're explosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we foughtI've always hated watching you leave 
That's what I did itSo you'd miss me 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all badwas itHuhSome of it wasgood 
Pretty good 
Some things never change 
TrueYou still drive me crazy 
If you see our son againbring him home 
She's just beginning to test her powersThe longer it takes to find herthe more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractional refresh rateKeeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed 
AlrightChewieget ready 
And Now 
I get any higherthey'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-downShe's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over that ridgeWe'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were based here 
Sanitation 
SanitationThen how do you know how to disable the shields 
I don'tI'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on usThe galaxy is counting on us 
Solowe'll figure it outWe'll use the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh reallyyou're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're hereless luck we're going to haveThe shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymoreThe name's Finnand I'm in chargeI'm in charge nowPhasmaI'm in charge 
Bring it downBring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket off your headLower the shields 
Do it 
Soloif this workswe're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kidwe won't leave here without her 
I disagreeWhat do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chuteTrash compactor 
Yeahthere is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did itSend them in 
Rogerbase red squadblue squadtake my lead 
Almost in rangeHit the target dead centeras many runs as we can get 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeahwe gotta keep hitting itAnother bombing runRememberwhen that sun is gonethat weapon will be ready to fireBut as long as there's lightwe got a chance 
Guyswe got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow that blast doorI'll go in and draw firebut I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tailWe have to be ready for thatThere's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing thatWhy are you doing thisI'm trying to come up with a plan

Escape nowHug later 
They're in troubleWe can't leaveMy friend here has a bag full of explosivesLet's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutesIt would take a miracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff

Snoke is using you for your powerWhen he gets what he wantshe'll crush you you know it's true 
It's too late 
No it's notLeave here with meCome homeWe miss you

Might wanna rethink your technique 
Where is it 
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you 
Whereis it 
It's in a droidBB unit 
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it 
I leave that to you

Last week they were a half portion each 
What about him 
Actuallythe droid's not for sale 
If what 
You with the Resistance 
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me 
You need a pilot 
We're gonna do this 
I am calm 
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot 
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire 
I can fix this 
I got it 
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far 
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp 
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot 
I saw it Hey what's your name

I'm Poe Poe Dameron 
Good to meet you Poe

Use the ventral cannons 
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot

Fire 
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it 
Hold onsee it 
Nice shot 
Where are you going 
We're going back to Jakku That's where 
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system 
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does 
What - a droid 
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white one of a kind 
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important 
This one is pal 
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die 
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker 
Oh you gotta be kidding meI 
No prior signs of non-conformity 
Destroyed 
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage 
Poe Poe 
PoePOE 
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiers General 
I won't have you question my methods 
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army 
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed 
Careful Ren That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke 
I want that map For your sakesuggest you get it 
Waterwaterwater 
Awgh GAH 
What's your hurry thief 
What Thief 
OW HEY What 
The jacket This droid says you stole it

It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right 
He was capturedby the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed 
So you're with the Resistance 
Obviously Yesam I'm with the Resistance yeah 
I've never met a Resistance fighter before 
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different

He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way 
What about the Rathtarswhere are you keeping them 
There's one 
What are you gonna do 
Same thing I always do talk my way out of it 
Bala-Tik What's the problem 
Can you see them 
No 
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other 
They have blasters 
A lot of 'em 
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money 
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub 
Tasu Leech Good to see you 
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before 
What was the second time 
First I've heard of it 
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs 
Close the blast doors from here 
Resetting the fuses should do it 
I got a bad feeling about this 
Oh no 
Oh no what 
Wrong fuses 
This was a mistake 
Huge 
What do they look like 
They look like that 
This way 
Are you sure 
Finn 
It had me But the door 
That was lucky 
I got the door Cover us 
Chewie You okay 
Wow Come on Come on 
Han 
You close the door behind us 
Hey where are you going 
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere 
I hate that guy 
And you could use a co-pilot 
I got one he's back there 
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed 
From inside the hangar Is that even possible 
I never ask that question until after I've done it 
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there 
No problem 
Come on baby don't let me down 
What 
Compressor 
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance 
Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise 
Supreme Leadertake full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change 
The weapon It is readybelieve the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker 
Go Oversee preparations 
Yes Supreme Leader 
There's been an awakening Have you felt it 
Yes 
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo 
He means nothing to me 
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test 
By the grace of your trainingwill not be seduced 
We shall see We shall see 
Electrical overload 
I can fix that 
The coolant's leaking 
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tankgot it 
Chewie come onneed help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie 
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me 
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine 
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems 
What'd you do 
I by-passed the compressor 
Move Ball 
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest 
Good job kid And thanks 
You're welcome 
So fugitives huh 
The First Order wants the map 
Finn is with the Resistance 
Let's see whatcha got 
Go ahead 
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him 
Why'd he leave 
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsibleHe walked away from everything 
Do you know what happened to him 
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple 
The Jedi were real 
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light 
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop 
I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy 
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here 
D'you just call me "Solo" 
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers 
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth 
Always 
You might need this 
I think I can handle myself 
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it 
You know how to use one of these 
Yeah you pull the trigger 
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name 
Rey 
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Reysecond mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon 
Are you offering me a job 
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much 
You're offering me a job 
I'm thinking about it 
Well 
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home 
Jakku 
I've already been away too long 
Chewie check out the ship as best you can 
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you 
Solo why are we here again 
To get your droid on a clean ship 
Clean 
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet 
We can trust her right 
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare 
At what 
Any of it 
Han Solo 
Hey Maz 
Where's my boyfriend 
Chewie's working on the Falcon 
I like that Wookieeassume you need something Desperately Let's get to it 
Forgive mefeel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started 
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess 
Mazneed you to get this droid to Leia 
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home 
Leia doesn't want to see me 
Please we came here for your help 
What fight 
The only fight against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us 
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized alreadybet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing 
Solo what is she doing 
I don't know but it ain't good 
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run 
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen 
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run 
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear 
Finn 
Come with me 
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base 
I can't 
Keep it kid 
Who's the girl 
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim 
What are you doing 
Don't leave without me 
You can't just gowon't let you 
I'm not who you think I am 
Finn what are you talking about 
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper 
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever hadwas ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me 
Don't go 
Take care of yourself Please 
What was thatshouldn't have gone in there 
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you 
I have to get back to Jakku 
Han told me Dear childsee your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back Butthere's someone who still could 
Luke 
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is aheadam no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it 
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it 
I'm never touching that againdon't want any part of this 
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember thisas the last day of the Republic 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey 
What are you doing 
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you 
I've had this for ages 
Kept it locked away 
Where'd you get that 
A good question for another time 
Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need 
No no no noREY 
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone 
Yeah yeahknow 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
I saw him Leiasaw our son He was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happenedgot thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life 
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you can tell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know 
Generalregret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do what She heads off 
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data 
Listen to me will youknow every time youevery time you look at me you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget himwant him back 
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to train with Lukejust never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in our own waywent back to the only thing I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jediyou're his father There's still light in himknow it 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator 
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you Youscavenger 
You know I can take whatever I want 
You're so lonelyso afraid to leaveAt night desperate to sleepyou imagine an oceansee it I see the island 
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you 
Get out of my head 
I know you've seen the map It's in thereand now you'll give it to me Don't be afraidfeel it too 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
Youyou're afraidthat you will never be as strong asDarth Vader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us 
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system 
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leadercan get the map from the girljust need your guidance 
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears 
The First Order they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd miss me 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood 
Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring him home 
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were based here 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us 
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send them in 
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead 
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan 
Are you all right 
Yeah 
Good 
What happened did he hurt you 
Finn What are you doing here 
We came back for you 
What'd he say 
That it was your idea 
Thank you 
How did you get away 
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it 
Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every other column 
You're right That's a better idea You take the top 
Find them 
Ben 
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time 
Take off that mask You don't need it 
What do you think you'll see if I do 
The face of my son 
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him 
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive 
No The Supreme Leader is wise 
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true 
It's too late 
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you 
I'm being torn apartwant to be free of this pain 
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me 
Yes Anything 
Thank you 
Solo 
No no 
The Falcon's this way 
We're not done yet 
You're a monster 
It's just us now Han Solo can't save you 
Rey Rey ReyReyOh no Oh no no no 
That lightsaber It belongs to me 
Come get it 
Red Four Red Six Cover us 
Everybody else hit the target hard Give it everything you got

Well because of you now we have a chance The General's been after this for a long time 
We've got company 
You have to hide 
Come on BB-8 Hurry 
I see 'em 
You take this It's safer with you than it is with me You get as far away from here as you can Do you hear me I'll come back for you It will be alright 
Look how old you've become 
You know what I've come for 
The map to Skywalker We know you've found it and now you're going to give it to the First Order 
I'll show you the dark side 
You're so right 
So who talks first You talk first 
The old man gave it to you 
It's just very hard to understand you with all the 
Search him 
 Apparatus 
Put him on board 
Kill them all 
All right All right 
Tal'ama parqual 
Parqual zatana 
Shhhh 
That's just Teedo Wants you for parts He has no respect for anyone Your antenna's bent Where do you come from 
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north you'll drown in the sand 
Don't follow me Town is that way No 
In the morning you go 
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board Comfortable 
Not really 
I'm impressed No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map 
Might wanna rethink your technique 
Where is it 
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you 
Where is it 
It's in a droid A BB unit 
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it 
I leave that to you 
Don't give up He still might show up Whoever it is you're waiting for Classified I know all about waiting 
For my family They'll be back One day Come on 
Last week they were a half portion each 
What about him 
Actually the droid's not for sale 
If what 
You with the Resistance 
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me 
You need a pilot 
We're gonna do this 
I am calm 
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot 
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire 
I can fix this 
I got it 
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far 
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp 
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot 
I saw it Hey what's your name 
FN-whaa 
Well I ain't using it FN huh Finn I'm gonna call you Finn That all right 
"Finn" Yeah "Finn" I like that I like that 
I'm Poe Poe Dameron 
Good to meet you Poe 
Good to meet you too Finn 
Use the ventral cannons 
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot 
Yes and he had help 
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was 
 The one from the village FN- 
Fire 
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it 
Hold on I see it 
Nice shot 
Where are you going 
We're going back to Jakku That's where 
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system 
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does 
What - a droid 
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white one of a kind 
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important 
This one is pal 
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die 
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker 
Oh you gotta be kidding me I 
No prior signs of non-conformity 
Destroyed 
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage 
Poe Poe 
Poe POE 
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiers General 
I won't have you question my methods 
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army 
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed 
Careful Ren That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke 
I want that map For your sake I suggest you get it 
Water water water 
Awgh GAH 
What's your hurry thief 
What Thief 
OW HEY What 
The jacket This droid says you stole it 
I've had a pretty messed up day alright So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW Where'd you get it It belongs to his master 
It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right 
He was captured by the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed 
So you're with the Resistance 
Obviously Yes I am I'm with the Resistance yeah 
I've never met a Resistance fighter before 
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different 
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base 
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it 
Luke Skywalker I thought he was a myth 
What is it 
What are you doing 
Come on 
Come on BB-8 
Let go of me 
No we gotta move 
I know how to run without you holding my hand BB-8 stay close This way 
They're shooting at both of us

You gotta tell us where the base is 
Pilex driver hurry

BACK TO JAK Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku  
No that one No No The one I'm pointing to No NO NO If we don't patch it up the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas 
This 
Yes 
Hey Rey You're a pilot you can fly anywhere Why go back You got a family You got a boyfriend Cute boyfriend

This is the Millennium Falcon You're Han Solo 
I used to be 
Han Solo The Rebellion General 
No the smuggler 
Wasn't he a war hero 
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs 
Twelve Fourteen 
Hey Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line 
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was a mistake too puts too much stress on 
Stress on the hyperdriveChewie throw 'em in a pod we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet 
Wait No we need your help 
My help 
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible 
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker 
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion You knew him 
Yeah I knew him I knew Luke 
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten 
Wait a what Did you just say Rathtars Hey 
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you 
I'm hauling Rathtars 
Oh great It's the Guavian Death Gang they must've tracked us from Nantoon 
What's a Rathtar 
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre 
No 
Good 
I got three of 'em going to King Prana 
THREE How'd you get them on board 
I used to have a bigger crew 
Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon 
What about BB-8 
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way 
What about the Rathtars where are you keeping them 
There's one 
What are you gonna do 
Same thing I always do talk my way out of it 
Bala-Tik What's the problem 
Can you see them 
No 
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other 
They have blasters 
A lot of 'em 
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money 
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub 
Tasu Leech Good to see you 
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before 
What was the second time 
First I've heard of it 
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs 
Close the blast doors from here 
Resetting the fuses should do it 
 I got a bad feeling about this 
Oh no 
Oh no what 
Wrong fuses 
This was a mistake 
Huge 
What do they look like 
They look like that 
This way 
Are you sure 
Finn 
It had me But the door 
That was lucky 
I got the door Cover us 
Chewie You okay 
Wow Come on Come on 
Han 
You close the door behind us 
Hey where are you going 
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere 
I hate that guy 
And you could use a co-pilot 
I got one he's back there 
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed 
From inside the hangar Is that even possible 
I never ask that question until after I've done it 
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there 
No problem 
Come on baby don't let me down 
What 
Compressor 
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance 
 Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise 
Supreme Leader I take full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change 
The weapon It is ready I believe the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker 
Go Oversee preparations 
Yes Supreme Leader 
There's been an awakening Have you felt it 
Yes 
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo 
He means nothing to me 
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test 
By the grace of your training I will not be seduced 
We shall see We shall see 
Electrical overload 
I can fix that 
The coolant's leaking 
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tank I got it 
Chewie come on I need help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie 
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me 
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine 
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems 
What'd you do 
I by-passed the compressor 
Move Ball 
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest 
Good job kid And thanks 
You're welcome 
So fugitives huh 
The First Order wants the map 
Finn is with the Resistance 
Let's see whatcha got 
Go ahead 
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him 
Why'd he leave 
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsible He walked away from everything 
Do you know what happened to him 
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple 
The Jedi were real 
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light 
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop 
 I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy 
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here 
D'you just call me "Solo" 
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers 
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth 
Always 
You might need this 
I think I can handle myself 
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it 
You know how to use one of these 
Yeah you pull the trigger 
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name 
Rey 
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Rey A second mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon 
Are you offering me a job 
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much 
You're offering me a job 
I'm thinking about it 
Well 
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home 
Jakku 
I've already been away too long 
Chewie check out the ship as best you can 
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you 
Solo why are we here again 
To get your droid on a clean ship 
Clean 
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet 
We can trust her right 
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare 
At what 
Any of it 
Han Solo 
Hey Maz 
Where's my boyfriend 
Chewie's working on the Falcon 
I like that Wookiee I assume you need something Desperately Let's get to it 
Forgive me I feel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started 
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess 
Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia 
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home 
Leia doesn't want to see me 
Please we came here for your help 
What fight 
The only fight against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us 
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized already I bet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing 
Solo what is she doing 
I don't know but it ain't good 
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run 
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen 
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run 
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear 
Finn 
Come with me 
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base 
I can't 
Keep it kid 
Who's the girl 
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim 
What are you doing 
Don't leave without me 
You can't just go I won't let you 
I'm not who you think I am 
Finn what are you talking about 
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper 
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever had I was ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me 
Don't go 
Take care of yourself Please 
What was that I shouldn't have gone in there 
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you 
I have to get back to Jakku 
Han told me Dear child I see your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back But there's someone who still could 
Luke 
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is ahead I am no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it 
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it 
I'm never touching that again I don't want any part of this 
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey 
What are you doing 
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you 
I've had this for ages 
Kept it locked away 
Where'd you get that 
A good question for another time 
Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need 
No no no no REY 
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone 
Yeah yeah I know 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
 I saw him Leia I saw our son He was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happened I got thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life 
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you can tell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know 
General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do what She heads off 
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data 
Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget him I want him back 
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator 
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger 
You know I can take whatever I want 
 You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island 
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you 
Get out of my head 
I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
 You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us 
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system 
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance 
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears 
The First Order they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd miss me 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood 
 Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring him home 
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were based here 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us 
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send them in 
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead 
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan 
Are you all right 
Yeah 
Good 
What happened did he hurt you 
Finn What are you doing here 
We came back for you 
What'd he say 
 That it was your idea 
Thank you 
How did you get away 
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it 
Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every other column 
You're right That's a better idea You take the top 
Find them 
Ben 
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time 
Take off that mask You don't need it 
What do you think you'll see if I do 
The face of my son 
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him 
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive 
No The Supreme Leader is wise 
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true 
It's too late 
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you 
I'm being torn apart I want to be free of this pain 
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me 
Yes Anything 
Thank you 
Solo 
No no 
The Falcon's this way 
We're not done yet 
You're a monster 
It's just us now Han Solo can't save you 
Rey Rey Rey Rey Oh no Oh no no no 
That lightsaber It belongs to me 
Come get it 
Red Four Red Six Cover us 
Everybody else hit the target hard Give it everything you got 
I need some help here I need some help 
All teams - I'm going in Pull up and cover me 
Prepare to fire 
You need a teacher I can show you the ways of the Force 
The Force 
Supreme Leader 
The fuel cells have ruptured The collapse of the planet has begun 
Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren 
Finn Finn 
All teams I got eyes on them 
Our job's done here Let's go home 
R2-D2 You've come back You found what How dare you call me that 
Find Master Luke how Come R2 We must go tell the others at once 
General Excuse me General 
R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news 
Tell me 
Yeah all right buddy hold on 
Oh The map It is complete 
Luke 
Oh my dear friend How I've missed you 
We'll see each other again I believe that Thank you my friend 
Rey 
May the Force be with you 
Well because of you now we have a chance The General's been after this for a long time 
We've got company 
You have to hide 
Come on BB-8 Hurry 
I see 'em 
You take this It's safer with you than it is with me You get as far away from here as you can Do you hear me I'll come back for you It will be alright 
Look how old you've become 
You know what I've come for 
The map to Skywalker We know you've found it and now you're going to give it to the First Order 
I'll show you the dark side 
You're so right 
So who talks first You talk first 
The old man gave it to you 
It's just very hard to understand you with all the 
Search him 
 Apparatus 
Put him on board 
Kill them all 
All right All right 
Tal'ama parqual 
Parqual zatana 
Shhhh 
That's just Teedo Wants you for parts He has no respect for anyone Your antenna's bent Where do you come from 
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north you'll drown in the sand 
Don't follow me Town is that way No 
In the morning you go 
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board Comfortable 
Not really 
I'm impressed No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map 
Might wanna rethink your technique 
Where is it 
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you 
Where is it 
It's in a droid A BB unit 
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it 
I leave that to you 
Don't give up He still might show up Whoever it is you're waiting for Classified I know all about waiting 
For my family They'll be back One day Come on 
Last week they were a half portion each 
What about him 
Actually the droid's not for sale 
If what 
You with the Resistance 
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me 
You need a pilot 
We're gonna do this 
I am calm 
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot 
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire 
I can fix this 
I got it 
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far 
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp 
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot 
I saw it Hey what's your name 
FN-whaa 
Well I ain't using it FN huh Finn I'm gonna call you Finn That all right 
"Finn" Yeah "Finn" I like that I like that 
I'm Poe Poe Dameron 
Good to meet you Poe 
Good to meet you too Finn 
Use the ventral cannons 
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot 
Yes and he had help 
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was 
 The one from the village FN- 
Fire 
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it 
Hold on I see it 
Nice shot 
Where are you going 
We're going back to Jakku That's where 
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system 
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does 
What - a droid 
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white one of a kind 
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important 
This one is pal 
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die 
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker 
Oh you gotta be kidding me I 
No prior signs of non-conformity 
Destroyed 
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage 
Poe Poe 
Poe POE 
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiers General 
I won't have you question my methods 
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army 
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed 
Careful Ren That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke 
I want that map For your sake I suggest you get it 
Water water water 
Awgh GAH 
What's your hurry thief 
What Thief 
OW HEY What 
The jacket This droid says you stole it 
I've had a pretty messed up day alright So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW Where'd you get it It belongs to his master 
It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right 
He was captured by the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed 
So you're with the Resistance 
Obviously Yes I am I'm with the Resistance yeah 
I've never met a Resistance fighter before 
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different 
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base 
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it 
Luke Skywalker I thought he was a myth 
What is it 
What are you doing 
Come on 
Come on BB-8 
Let go of me 
No we gotta move 
I know how to run without you holding my hand BB-8 stay close This way 
They're shooting at both of us 
Yeah they saw you with me You're marked 
Well thanks for that 
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick Does anyone have blasters around here 
Are you okay 
Stop taking my hand 
Hey 
Are you okay

Try sitting in this thing 
We need cover quick

How bad is it 
If we wanna live not good 
They're hunting for us now we gotta get outta this system 
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" if I'm taking you there I need to know 
This 
You gotta tell us where the base is 
Pilex driver hurry 
So where's your base 
Go on BB-8 tell her

I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal I need the bonding tape hurry 
What about you

BACK TO JAK Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku  
No that one No No The one I'm pointing to No NO NO If we don't patch it up the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas 
This 
Yes 
Hey Rey You're a pilot you can fly anywhere Why go back You got a family You got a boyfriend Cute boyfriend 
None of your business THAT'S WHY 
 That can't be good 
No it can't be 
Someone's locked onto us all controls are overridden 
Get off Get off See anything 
 Oh no 
It's the First Order 
What do we dothere must be 
You said poisonous gas 
Yeah but I fixed that 
Can you unfix it 
C'mon BB-8 
I got it 
Oooh 
I'm okay BB-8 get off me 
You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers 
Yeah Their masks filter out smoke not toxins 
Hurry 
I'm hurrying 
Chewie we're home 
Where are the others Where's the pilot 
I'm the pilot 
You 
No it's true we're the only ones on board 
You can understand that thing 
And "that thing" can understand you too so watch it Come on outta there 
Where'd you get this ship 
Niima Outpost 
Jakku That junkyard 
Thank you Junkyard 
Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches 
I stole it from Unkar Plutt He stole it from the Irving Boys who stole it from Ducain 
Who stole it from me Well you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good 
This is the Millennium Falcon You're Han Solo 
I used to be 
Han Solo The Rebellion General 
No the smuggler 
Wasn't he a war hero 
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs 
Twelve Fourteen 
Hey Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line 
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was a mistake too puts too much stress on 
Stress on the hyperdriveChewie throw 'em in a pod we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet 
Wait No we need your help 
My help 
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible 
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker 
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion You knew him 
Yeah I knew him I knew Luke 
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten 
Wait a what Did you just say Rathtars Hey 
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you 
I'm hauling Rathtars 
Oh great It's the Guavian Death Gang they must've tracked us from Nantoon 
What's a Rathtar 
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre 
No 
Good 
I got three of 'em going to King Prana 
THREE How'd you get them on board 
I used to have a bigger crew 
Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon 
What about BB-8 
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way 
What about the Rathtars where are you keeping them 
There's one 
What are you gonna do 
Same thing I always do talk my way out of it 
Bala-Tik What's the problem 
Can you see them 
No 
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other 
They have blasters 
A lot of 'em 
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money 
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub 
Tasu Leech Good to see you 
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before 
What was the second time 
First I've heard of it 
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs 
Close the blast doors from here 
Resetting the fuses should do it 
 I got a bad feeling about this 
Oh no 
Oh no what 
Wrong fuses 
This was a mistake 
Huge 
What do they look like 
They look like that 
This way 
Are you sure 
Finn 
It had me But the door 
That was lucky 
I got the door Cover us 
Chewie You okay 
Wow Come on Come on 
Han 
You close the door behind us 
Hey where are you going 
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere 
I hate that guy 
And you could use a co-pilot 
I got one he's back there 
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed 
From inside the hangar Is that even possible 
I never ask that question until after I've done it 
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there 
No problem 
Come on baby don't let me down 
What 
Compressor 
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance 
 Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise 
Supreme Leader I take full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change 
The weapon It is ready I believe the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker 
Go Oversee preparations 
Yes Supreme Leader 
There's been an awakening Have you felt it 
Yes 
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo 
He means nothing to me 
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test 
By the grace of your training I will not be seduced 
We shall see We shall see 
Electrical overload 
I can fix that 
The coolant's leaking 
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tank I got it 
Chewie come on I need help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie 
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me 
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine 
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems 
What'd you do 
I by-passed the compressor 
Move Ball 
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest 
Good job kid And thanks 
You're welcome 
So fugitives huh 
The First Order wants the map 
Finn is with the Resistance 
Let's see whatcha got 
Go ahead 
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him 
Why'd he leave 
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsible He walked away from everything 
Do you know what happened to him 
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple 
The Jedi were real 
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light 
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop 
 I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy 
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here 
D'you just call me "Solo" 
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers 
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth 
Always 
You might need this 
I think I can handle myself 
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it 
You know how to use one of these 
Yeah you pull the trigger 
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name 
Rey 
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Rey A second mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon 
Are you offering me a job 
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much 
You're offering me a job 
I'm thinking about it 
Well 
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home 
Jakku 
I've already been away too long 
Chewie check out the ship as best you can 
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you 
Solo why are we here again 
To get your droid on a clean ship 
Clean 
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet 
We can trust her right 
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare 
At what 
Any of it 
Han Solo 
Hey Maz 
Where's my boyfriend 
Chewie's working on the Falcon 
I like that Wookiee I assume you need something Desperately Let's get to it 
Forgive me I feel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started 
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess 
Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia 
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home 
Leia doesn't want to see me 
Please we came here for your help 
What fight 
The only fight against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us 
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized already I bet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing 
Solo what is she doing 
I don't know but it ain't good 
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run 
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen 
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run 
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear 
Finn 
Come with me 
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base 
I can't 
Keep it kid 
Who's the girl 
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim 
What are you doing 
Don't leave without me 
You can't just go I won't let you 
I'm not who you think I am 
Finn what are you talking about 
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper 
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever had I was ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me 
Don't go 
Take care of yourself Please 
What was that I shouldn't have gone in there 
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you 
I have to get back to Jakku 
Han told me Dear child I see your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back But there's someone who still could 
Luke 
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is ahead I am no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it 
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it 
I'm never touching that again I don't want any part of this 
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey 
What are you doing 
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you 
I've had this for ages 
Kept it locked away 
Where'd you get that 
A good question for another time 
Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need 
No no no no REY 
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone 
Yeah yeah I know 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
 I saw him Leia I saw our son He was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happened I got thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life 
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you can tell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know 
General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do what She heads off 
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data 
Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget him I want him back 
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator 
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger 
You know I can take whatever I want 
 You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island 
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you 
Get out of my head 
I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
 You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us 
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system 
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance 
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears 
The First Order they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd miss me 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood 
 Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring him home 
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were based here 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us 
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send them in 
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead 
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan 
Are you all right 
Yeah 
Good 
What happened did he hurt you 
Finn What are you doing here 
We came back for you 
What'd he say 
 That it was your idea 
Thank you 
How did you get away 
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it 
Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every other column 
You're right That's a better idea You take the top 
Find them 
Ben 
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time 
Take off that mask You don't need it 
What do you think you'll see if I do 
The face of my son 
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him 
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive 
No The Supreme Leader is wise 
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true 
It's too late 
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you 
I'm being torn apart I want to be free of this pain 
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me 
Yes Anything 
Thank you 
Solo 
No no 
The Falcon's this way 
We're not done yet 
You're a monster 
It's just us now Han Solo can't save you 
Rey Rey Rey Rey Oh no Oh no no no 
That lightsaber It belongs to me 
Come get it 
Red Four Red Six Cover us 
Everybody else hit the target hard Give it everything you got 
I need some help here I need some help 
All teams - I'm going in Pull up and cover me 
Prepare to fire 
You need a teacher I can show you the ways of the Force 
The Force 
Supreme Leader 
The fuel cells have ruptured The collapse of the planet has begun 
Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren 
Finn Finn 
All teams I got eyes on them 
Our job's done here Let's go home 
R2-D2 You've come back You found what How dare you call me that 
Find Master Luke how Come R2 We must go tell the others at once

Tell me 
Yeah all right buddy hold on 
Oh The map It is complete 
Luke 
Oh my dear friend How I've missed you 
We'll see each other again I believe that Thank you my friend 
Rey 
May the Force be with you 
Well because of you now we have a chance The General's been after this for a long time 
We've got company 
You have to hide 
Come on BB-8 Hurry 
I see 'em 
You take this It's safer with you than it is with me You get as far away from here as you can Do you hear me I'll come back for you It will be alright 
Look how old you've become 
You know what I've come for 
The map to Skywalker We know you've found it and now you're going to give it to the First Order 
I'll show you the dark side 
You're so right 
So who talks first You talk first 
The old man gave it to you 
It's just very hard to understand you with all the 
Search him 
 Apparatus 
Put him on board 
Kill them all 
All right All right 
Tal'ama parqual 
Parqual zatana 
Shhhh 
That's just Teedo Wants you for parts He has no respect for anyone Your antenna's bent Where do you come from 
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north you'll drown in the sand 
Don't follow me Town is that way No 
In the morning you go 
I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board Comfortable 
Not really 
I'm impressed No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map 
Might wanna rethink your technique 
Where is it 
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you 
Where is it 
It's in a droid A BB unit 
Well then If it's on Jakku we'll soon have it 
I leave that to you 
Don't give up He still might show up Whoever it is you're waiting for Classified I know all about waiting 
For my family They'll be back One day Come on 
Last week they were a half portion each 
What about him 
Actually the droid's not for sale 
If what 
You with the Resistance 
I can fly anything Why why are you helping me 
You need a pilot 
We're gonna do this 
I am calm 
I always wanted to fly one of these things Can ya shoot 
Okay same principal Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse use the site on the right to aim triggers to fire 
I can fix this 
I got it 
Woooahhh This thing really moves All right we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far 
I'm gonna get us in position just stay sharp 
Up ahead Up ahead You see it I've got us dead centered It's a clean shot 
I saw it Hey what's your name 
FN-whaa 
Well I ain't using it FN huh Finn I'm gonna call you Finn That all right 
Finn Yeah Finn I like that I like that 
I'm Poe Poe Dameron 
Good to meet you Poe 
Good to meet you too Finn 
Use the ventral cannons 
General Hux Is it the Resistance pilot 
Yes and he had help 
We're checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was 
 The one from the village FN- 
Fire 
One's coming towards you My right your left Do you see it 
Hold on I see it 
Nice shot 
Where are you going 
We're going back to Jakku That's where 
No no no We can't go back to Jakku We need to get outta this system 
I got to get to my droid before the First Order does 
What - a droid 
That's right He's a BB unit Orange and white one of a kind 
I don't care what color he is No droid can be that important 
This one is pal 
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can We go back to Jakku we die 
That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker 
Oh you gotta be kidding me I 
No prior signs of non-conformity 
Destroyed 
They were going back for the droid send a squad to the wreckage 
Poe Poe 
Poe POE 
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must 
How capable are your soldiers General 
I won't have you question my methods 
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army 
My men are exceptionally trained programmed from birth 
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid Unharmed 
Careful Ren That your personal interests not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke 
I want that map For your sake I suggest you get it 
Water water water 
Awgh GAH 
What's your hurry thief 
What Thief 
OW HEY What 
The jacket This droid says you stole it 
I've had a pretty messed up day alright So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me OW Where'd you get it It belongs to his master 
It belonged to Poe Dameron That was his name right 
He was captured by the First Order I helped him escape but our ship crashed 
So you're with the Resistance 
Obviously Yes I am I'm with the Resistance yeah 
I've never met a Resistance fighter before 
Well this is what we look like Some of us Others look different 
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission he has to get back to your base 
Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it 
Luke Skywalker I thought he was a myth 
What is it 
What are you doing 
Come on 
Come on BB-8 
Let go of me 
No we gotta move 
I know how to run without you holding my hand BB-8 stay close This way 
They're shooting at both of us 
Yeah they saw you with me You're marked 
Well thanks for that 
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick Does anyone have blasters around here 
Are you okay 
Stop taking my hand 
Hey 
Are you okay 
Yeah Follow me 
We can't outrun them 
We might in that quad-jumper 
We need a pilot 
We've got one 
You What about that ship 
That one's garbage 
The garbage'll do 
Gunner position's down there 
Y'ever fly this thing 
No This ship hasn't been flown in years 
Great Whoa I can do this I can do this 
I can do this I can do this 
Whoa Hey Oh Stay low Stay low 
Stay low It confuses their tracking 
BB-8 hold on 
What are you doing back there Are you ever gonna fire back 
I'm working on it Are the shields up 
Not so easy without a co-pilot 
Try sitting in this thing 
We need cover quick 
We're about to get some 
Damn it 
Come on come on 
Nice shot 
I'm getting pretty good at this 
The cannon's stuck in forward position I can't move it You gotta lose 'em 
Get ready 
Okay For what

I'm the pilot 
You 
No it's true we're the only ones on board 
You can understand that thing 
And that thing can understand you too so watch it Come on outta there 
Where'd you get this ship 
Niima Outpost 
Jakku That junkyard 
Thank you Junkyard 
Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches 
I stole it from Unkar Plutt He stole it from the Irving Boys who stole it from Ducain 
Who stole it from me Well you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good 
This is the Millennium Falcon You're Han Solo 
I used to be 
Han Solo The Rebellion General 
No the smuggler 
Wasn't he a war hero 
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs 
Twelve Fourteen 
Hey Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line 
Unkar Plutt did I thought it was a mistake too puts too much stress on 
Stress on the hyperdriveChewie throw 'em in a pod we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet 
Wait No we need your help 
My help 
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible 
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker 
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion You knew him 
Yeah I knew him I knew Luke 
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten 
Wait a what Did you just say Rathtars Hey 
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you 
I'm hauling Rathtars 
Oh great It's the Guavian Death Gang they must've tracked us from Nantoon 
What's a Rathtar 
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre 
No 
Good 
I got three of 'em going to King Prana 
THREE How'd you get them on board 
I used to have a bigger crew 
Get below deck and stay there until I say so don't even think about taking the Falcon 
What about BB-8 
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang then you can have him back and be on your way 
What about the Rathtars where are you keeping them 
There's one 
What are you gonna do 
Same thing I always do talk my way out of it 
Bala-Tik What's the problem 
Can you see them 
No 
You know you can't trust those little freaks How long've we known each other 
They have blasters 
A lot of 'em 
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap I spent that money 
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub 
Tasu Leech Good to see you 
Boys You're both gonna get what I promised Have I ever not delivered for you before 
What was the second time 
First I've heard of it 
Wait wait wait wait If we close the blast doors in that corridor we can trap both gangs 
Close the blast doors from here 
Resetting the fuses should do it 
 I got a bad feeling about this 
Oh no 
Oh no what 
Wrong fuses 
This was a mistake 
Huge 
What do they look like 
They look like that 
This way 
Are you sure 
Finn 
It had me But the door 
That was lucky 
I got the door Cover us 
Chewie You okay 
Wow Come on Come on 
Han 
You close the door behind us 
Hey where are you going 
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere 
I hate that guy 
And you could use a co-pilot 
I got one he's back there 
Watch the thrust we're goin' out of here at lightspeed 
From inside the hangar Is that even possible 
I never ask that question until after I've done it 
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go angle the shields Hang on back there 
No problem 
Come on baby don't let me down 
What 
Compressor 
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance 
 Leading them to the last Jedi If Skywalker returns the new Jedi will rise 
Supreme Leader I take full responsibility for th 
General Our strategy must now change 
The weapon It is ready I believe the time has come to use it We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance the Republic Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker 
Go Oversee preparations 
Yes Supreme Leader 
There's been an awakening Have you felt it 
Yes 
There's something more The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon In the hands of your father Han Solo 
He means nothing to me 
Even you master of the Knights of Ren have never faced such a test 
By the grace of your training I will not be seduced 
We shall see We shall see 
Electrical overload 
I can fix that 
The coolant's leaking 
Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank 
Secondary tank I got it 
Chewie come on I need help with this giant hairy thing Stop moving Chewie 
You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me 
Hurt him He almost killed me six times Which is fine 
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems 
What'd you do 
I by-passed the compressor 
Move Ball 
Nah don't say that you did great Just rest 
Good job kid And thanks 
You're welcome 
So fugitives huh 
The First Order wants the map 
Finn is with the Resistance 
Let's see whatcha got 
Go ahead 
This map's not complete It's just a piece Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him 
Why'd he leave 
He was training a new generation of Jedi One boy an apprentice turned against him destroyed it all Luke felt responsible He walked away from everything 
Do you know what happened to him 
There're a lot of rumors Stories The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple 
The Jedi were real 
I used to wonder that myself Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo magical power holding together good evil the dark side and the light 
No you rest You want my help You're getting it Gonna see an old friend She'll get your droid home This is our stop 
 I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy 
Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here 
D'you just call me Solo 
Sorry HanMr Solo You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance Which puts a real target on my back Are there any conspirators here First Order sympathizers 
Listen big deal you've got another problem Women always figure out the truth 
Always 
You might need this 
I think I can handle myself 
I know you do That's why I'm giving it to you Take it 
You know how to use one of these 
Yeah you pull the trigger 
There's a little bit more to it than that You got a lot to learn You got a name 
Rey 
Rey I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew Rey A second mate Someone to help out Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon 
Are you offering me a job 
I wouldn't be nice to you It doesn't pay much 
You're offering me a job 
I'm thinking about it 
Well 
If you were I'd be flattered But I have to get home 
Jakku 
I've already been away too long 
Chewie check out the ship as best you can 
It's too bad Chewie kind of likes you 
Solo why are we here again 
To get your droid on a clean ship 
Clean 
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon If we can find it on our scanners the First Order's not far behind Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance Maz Kanata is our best bet 
We can trust her right 
Relax kid She's run this watering hole for a thousand years Maz is a bit of an acquired taste so let me do the talking And whatever you do don't stare 
At what 
Any of it 
Han Solo 
Hey Maz 
Where's my boyfriend 
Chewie's working on the Falcon 
I like that Wookiee I assume you need something Desperately Let's get to it 
Forgive me I feel it again The pull to the light Supreme Leader senses it Show me again the power of the darkness and I will let nothing stand in our way Show me Grandfather and I will finish what you started 
A map to Skywalker himself You're right back in the mess 
Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia 
Hmm No You've been running away from this fight for too long Han nyakee nago wadda Go home 
Leia doesn't want to see me 
Please we came here for your help 
What fight 
The only fight against the dark side Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms The Sith The Empire Today it is the First Order Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy We must face them Fight them All of us 
There is no fight against the First Order Not one we can win Look around There's no chance we haven't been recognized already I bet you the First Order is on their way right 
What's this What are you doing 
Solo what is she doing 
I don't know but it ain't good 
If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run 
You don't know a thing about me Where I'm from What I've seen 
You don't know the First Order like I do They'll slaughter us We all need to run 
You see those two They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim There you can disappear 
Finn 
Come with me 
What about BB-8 We're not done yet We have to get him back to your base 
I can't 
Keep it kid 
Who's the girl 
I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim 
What are you doing 
Don't leave without me 
You can't just go I won't let you 
I'm not who you think I am 
Finn what are you talking about 
I'm not Resistance I'm not a hero I'm a Stormtrooper 
Right into you And you looked at me like no one ever had I was ashamed of what I was But I'm done with the First Order I'm never going back Rey come with me 
Don't go 
Take care of yourself Please 
What was that I shouldn't have gone in there 
That lightsaber was Luke's And his father's before him and now it calls to you 
I have to get back to Jakku 
Han told me Dear child I see your eyes You already know the truth Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku they're never coming back But there's someone who still could 
Luke 
The belonging you seek is not behind you It is ahead I am no Jedi but I know the Force It moves through and surrounds every living thing Close your eyes Feel it 
The light It's always been there It will guide you The saber Take it 
I'm never touching that again I don't want any part of this 
Today is the end of the Republic The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder At this very moment in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate To their cherished fleet All remaining systems will bow to the First Order And will remember this as the last day of the Republic 
It was the Republic 
The First Order they've done it Where's Rey 
What are you doing 
BB-8 No you can't you have to go back you're too important They'll help you 
I've had this for ages 
Kept it locked away 
Where'd you get that 
A good question for another time 
Those beasts They're here 
Safety 
You have to keep going stay out of sight I'll try to fight 'em off I hope so too 
Come on Chewie 
Rey and BB-8 they need you Now go 
I need a weapon 
You have one 
Hey can I try that 
I like this thing 
You okay Big deal 
Thanks 
It's the Resistance 
Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you 
Quick 
Woohoo YEAH That's one helluva pilot 
The girl I've heard so much about 
The droid 
Where is it 
The map You've seen it 
Pull the division out Forget the droid We have what we need 
No no no no REY 
He took her Did you see that He took her She's gone 
Yeah yeah I know 
Goodness Han Solo It is I See- Threepio You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm Look who it is Did you see who Oh Excuse me Prinuh General Sorry Come along BB-8 Quickly 
You changed your hair 
Same jacket 
No new jacket 
 I saw him Leia I saw our son He was here 
Poe Poe Dameron 
You're alive 
So are you 
What happened to you 
What happened I got thrown from the crash woke up at night no you no ship nothing 
BB-8 says that you saved him 
No no no It wasn't just me 
You completed my mission Finn That's my jacket 
Oh here 
No no no Keep it It suits you You're a good man Finn 
Poe I need your help 
General Organa Sorry to interrupt this is Finn he needs to talk to 
And I need to talk to him That was incredibly brave what you did Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life 
Thank you ma'am but a friend of mine was taken prisoner 
Han told me about the girl I'm sorry 
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system He worked on the base 
We're desperate for anything you can tell us 
That's where my friend was taken I've got to get there fast 
And I will do everything I can to help but first you must tell us all you know 
General I regret to inform you but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete And even worse it matches no charted system on record We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke 
I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home 
Leia 
Don't do that 
Do what She heads off 
Anything Flummoxed Han follows looking at C-3PO 
Princesses 
I'm trying to be helpful 
When did that ever help And don't say the Death Star 
BB-8 You're wasting your time 
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data 
Listen to me will you I know every time you every time you look at me you're reminded of him 
You think I want to forget him I want him back 
There was nothing we could've done There was too much Vader in him 
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke I just never should have sent him away That's when I lost him That's when I lost you both 
We both had to deal with it in our own way I went back to the only thing I was ever good at 
We both did 
We lost our son forever 
No 
He seduced our son to the dark side But we can still save him Me You 
If Luke couldn't reach him how could 
Luke is a Jedi you're his father There's still light in him I know it 
Where am I 
You're my guest 
Where are the others 
You mean the murderers traitors and thieves you call friends You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea 
You still want to kill me 
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask 
Tell me about the droid 
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator 
He's carrying a section of a navigational chart We have the rest recovered from archives of the Empire We need the last piece And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you You A scavenger 
You know I can take whatever I want 
 You're so lonely so afraid to leave At night desperate to sleep you imagine an ocean I see it I see the island 
And Han Solo You feel like he's the father you never had He would've disappointed you 
Get out of my head 
I know you've seen the map It's in there and now you'll give it to me Don't be afraid I feel it too 
I'm not giving you anything 
We'll see 
 You you're afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader 
This scavenger resisted you 
She's strong with the Force untrained but stronger than she knows 
And the droid 
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us 
That the girl was all we needed As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy They may have the map already 
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker 
We have their location We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system 
Good Then we will crush them once and for all Prepare the weapon 
Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl I just need your guidance 
If what you say about this girl is true bring her to me 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
You will remove these restraints And leave this cell with the door open 
And you will drop your weapon 
Begin charging the weapon 
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report 
I wish that were the case Major 
This was the Death Star 
This is Starkiller Base 
So it's big 
It uses the power of the sun As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears 
The First Order they're charging the weapon again now Our system is the next target 
Oh my Without the Republic fleet we're doomed 
Okay how do we blow it up There's always a way to do that 
Han's right 
There is one 
Precinct 47 Here 
We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got 
We disable the shields 
I can do it 
I like this guy 
I can disable the shields But I have to be there on the planet 
We'll get you there 
Han how 
If I told you you wouldn't like it 
So we disable the shields take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun All right Let's go 
Chewie check that donal capitator Come on Let's go Finn be careful with those - they're explosives 
Now you tell me 
No matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave 
That's what I did it So you'd miss me 
I did miss you 
It wasn't all bad was it Huh Some of it wasgood 
 Pretty good 
Some things never change 
True You still drive me crazy 
If you see our son again bring him home 
She's just beginning to test her powers The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes 
How are we getting in 
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through 
We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed 
Alright Chewie get ready 
And Now 
I get any higher they'll see us 
Put every hangar on lock-down She's going to try to steal a ship to 
Han Solo 
The flooding tunnels are over that ridge We'll get in that way 
What was your job when you were based here 
Sanitation 
Sanitation Then how do you know how to disable the shields 
I don't I'm just here to get Rey 
People are counting on us The galaxy is counting on us 
Solo we'll figure it out We'll use the Force 
That's not how the Force works 
Oh really you're cold 
Come on 
Report 
The longer we're here less luck we're going to have The shields 
I have an idea about that 
Remember me 
Not anymore The name's Finn and I'm in charge I'm in charge now Phasma I'm in charge 
Bring it down Bring it down 
Follow me 
You want me to blast that bucket off your head Lower the shields 
Do it 
Solo if this works we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey 
Don't worry kid we won't leave here without her 
I disagree What do we do with her 
Is there a garbage chute Trash compactor 
Yeah there is 
Thank the Maker 
Han did it Send them in 
Roger base red squad blue squad take my lead 
Almost in range Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get 
Dispatch all squadrons 
Let's light it up 
Yeah we gotta keep hitting it Another bombing run Remember when that sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire But as long as there's light we got a chance 
Guys we got a lot of company 
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover 
You sure you're up for this 
Hell no I'll go in find and try to find Rey The troopers'll be on our tail We have to be ready for that There's an access tunnel that'll leads Why are you doing that Why are you doing this I'm trying to come up with a plan 
Are you all right 
Yeah 
Good 
What happened did he hurt you 
Finn What are you doing here 
We came back for you 
What'd he say 
 That it was your idea 
Thank you 
How did you get away 
I can't explain it And you wouldn't believe it 
Escape now Hug later 
They're in trouble We can't leave My friend here has a bag full of explosives Let's use 'em 
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes It would take a miracle to save us now 
That girl knows her stuff 
We'll set the charges at every other column 
You're right That's a better idea You take the top 
Find them 
Ben 
Han Solo I've been waiting for this day for a long time 
Take off that mask You don't need it 
What do you think you'll see if I do 
The face of my son 
Your son is gone He was weak and foolish like his father So I destroyed him 
That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true My son is alive 
No The Supreme Leader is wise 
Snoke is using you for your power When he gets what he wants he'll crush you you know it's true 
It's too late 
No it's not Leave here with me Come home We miss you 
I'm being torn apart I want to be free of this pain 
I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it Will you help me 
Yes Anything 
Thank you 
Solo 
No no 
The Falcon's this way 
We're not done yet 
You're a monster 
It's just us now Han Solo can't save you 
Rey Rey Rey Rey Oh no Oh no no no 
That lightsaber It belongs to me 
Come get it 
Red Four Red Six Cover us 
Everybody else hit the target hard Give it everything you got 
I need some help here I need some help 
All teams - I'm going in Pull up and cover me 
Prepare to fire 
You need a teacher I can show you the ways of the Force 
The Force 
Supreme Leader 
The fuel cells have ruptured The collapse of the planet has begun 
Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren 
Finn Finn 
All teams I got eyes on them

Rey
